Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot.
But the Grinch who lived just North of Whoville did not!

The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.

It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.

But, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,

Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown
At the warm lighted windows below in their town,

For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath
Was busy now hanging a hollywho wreath.

"And they're hanging their stockings," he snarled with a sneer.
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"

Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
"I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming!

For, tomorrow, I know all the Who girls and boys
Will wake bright and early. They'll rush for their toys!

And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!
There's one thing I hate! All the NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!

They'll stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
They'll stand hand-in-hand, and those Whos will start singing!"

Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas! Come this way
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas, Christmas Day

Welcome, welcome, fahoo ramus
Welcome, welcome, dahoo damus
Christmas Day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp

Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays...

"And they'll sing! And they'll sing! And they'll SING! SING! SING! SING!"
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who Christmas Sing,
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!

Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
I must stop Christmas from coming! But how?"

Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!

"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
"I'll make a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat."

"This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
As he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.

Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.

He got stuck only once, for a minute or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue

Where the little Who stockings hung all in a row.
"These stockings," he grinched, "are the first things to go!"

Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Around the whole room, and he took every present!

It was quarter of dawn. All the Whos still a-bed,
All the Whos still a-snooze, when he packed up his sled,

Packed it up with their presents, their ribbons, their wrappings,
Their snoof and their fuzzles, their tringlers and trappings!

Ten thousand feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpet,
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!

"Pooh-pooh to the Whos!" he was grinchily humming.
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!

They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry boo-hoo!

That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "that I simply must hear!"
He paused, and the Grinch put a hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low, then it started to grow.

But this sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded glad!

Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing without any presents at all!

He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming! It came!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

And the Grinch, with his grinch feet ice-cold in the snow,
Stood puzzling and puzzling. "How could it be so?

It came without ribbons! It came without tags!
It came without packages, boxes, or bags!"

He puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.

Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.
Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more!

And what happened then? Well, in Whoville they say
That the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day!

And then the true meaning of Christmas came through,
And the Grinch found the strength of ten Grinches, plus two!

And now that his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light

With a smile to his soul, he descended Mount Crumpet
Cheerily blowing "Who! Who!" on his trumpet.

He rode into Whoville. He brought back their toys.
He brought back their floof to the Who girls and boys.

He brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzles,
Brought back their pantookas, their dafflers and wuzzles.

He brought everything back, all the food for the feast!
And he, he himself, the Grinch carved the roast beast!

Welcome Christmas. Bring your cheer,
Cheer to all Whos, far and near.

Christmas Day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to grasp.

Christmas Day will always be
Just as long as we have we.

Welcome Christmas while we stand
Heart to heart and hand in hand.




Look! It's Turbo Man and Booster!
Kill them both!
Turbo disk, anyone?
Stop him!
Go, go, Demon Team!
Help, Turbo Man!
I'm coming, Billy!
Ta-ta, Turbo Man.
Five seconds to ignition.
It's Turbo Time!
You haven't seen
the last of me, Turbo Man!
I'll have my revenge!
Here you go, Mr. President.
Thank you, Turbo Man.
You can always count on me.
Go upstairs and change, hon.
It's almost time to leave.
But Dad's not home yet.
He'll probably miss me get my belt.
He misses everything.
He won't miss this.
He's probably just working hard.
Hello, Mr. Jacobs.
I'm going to make it.
200 by next Friday?
No problem. But only for you, because
you're our number one customer.
Andrea, hi.
If you think the fabric's too dark,
we'll just re-cover it...
...at no extra charge.
What do you expect?
You're my number one customer.
And don't you forget,
you're my number one customer.
You're my number one customer.
Honey, how are you?
Howard, where are you?
I know, Jamie's karate class.
Don't worry, I'll meet you there.
I promise. Don't forget...
...you're my number one customer.
Look, I didn't mean that.
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it.
He's not gonna make it.
What the...?
The kids look great.
Yeah, they do.
Ted, I baked you some cookies.
You know, to thank you for
fixing my screen door.
Thanks, Judy.
Ted, I was wondering if you'd mind
taking a look at my porch light?
Just doesn't
seem to be working and...
...you being such a handyman...
Sure, I've got just the tool
for the job.
I'm gonna make it.
Damn it!
Two!
Three!
License and registration, please.
I'm in kind of a hurry.
I'm late for my son's
karate class.
Oh, I do apologize if I've caused you
some sort of delay.
How thoughtless of me.
The last thing I want
on my conscience right now...
...is for a private citizen
to somehow be disappointed...
...in the performance of my duty.
Look, I was not criticizing you,
officer.
Step out of the car.
That's my boy!
There.
Are we finished now?
Recite the alphabet.
A, B, C...
Backwards.
Way to go, Jamie!
I didn't make it.
Hey, neighbor!
Ted!
What are you doing on my roof?
What's Ted doing on your roof?
I had some extra lights.
Since you didn't
put up any yourself...
...I thought, why not spread Christmas
cheer around the neighborhood?
Gee, Ted.
How thoughtful.
Sorry you missed the karate class.
Don't worry, I got it all
on video for you.
What would I do without you?
Did you tell Ted he could put
lights up on our house?
Do you know what time it is?
I know. On top of the traffic
I got a speeding ticket.
Don't explain it to me.
It wasn't my karate class you missed.
Hi, buddy.
It's Turbo Time.
Now's your chance to save the
universe with Turbo Man.
Battle evil with America's favorite
superhero and his sidekick, Booster.
Jamie...
...about that karate class tonight...
I was trying to...
Jamie, stop!
Listen.
It was not my fault.
Don't walk away from your father.
Can I come in?
So, champ...
...are those hands registered weapons?
Is this it?
Wow! This is really cool.
How do you do this?
Like this?
No, I know.
Like this.
What do you think?
How about this?
I did something
really stupid today.
I don't care.
Come on, Jamie.
I hope that's not true, because
I really wanted to be there.
Believe me.
You always say that,
and you never come anyways.
Purple was important to me, Dad.
That's one away from green
and three away from black.
I saw you get yellow.
But you missed blue.
You're right.
I really blew it.
I'm really, really sorry.
Can I make it up to you?
Like how?
Like letting me
do something special...
...just for you.
If there's something important you've
been wanting for Christmas...
Don't worry, I got it covered.
I wrote Santa.
But Santa gets very busy
this time of year.
Sometimes he has to ask
moms and dads to help out.
No, it's not that important.
Tell me.
What do you want?
I want the Turbo Man action figure
with arms and legs that move...
...and the boomerang and
the rocking rolling jetpack...
...and the voice activator
that says 5 different phrases...
...including "It's Turbo Time!"
Accessories sold separately.
Batteries not included.
I'm glad you had to think about it.
Johnny's getting one
and so is everybody I know!
Whoever doesn't
is gonna be a real loser.
That definitely won't be you.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you.
I love you too, Jamie.
You should have seen us.
We were bonding.
We were drawing, laughing,
talking about that Turbo guy.
Turbo Man.
Which reminds me.
You got the doll, right?
The doll?
The Turbo Man doll. I asked you to
pick one up two weeks ago...?
That doll. Of course.
You didn't.
Please tell me
you didn't forget that doll.
No, no, I...
I got it.
The Turbo Man doll with
those things that shoot out...
...with the rock 'em,
sock 'em jetpack...
...and the realistic voice box that
says "It's Turbo Time." I got it.
Good.
There you are.
You thought for a minute that I would
not do something you tell me.
I got it...
...right away.
Good.
Because at this point,
they'd probably be impossible to find.
KQRS Minneapolis. We'll do the
rockin' while you fill the stockin'.
Wait! Hey, where you going?
I just have to run to the office
quickly. That's it.
Howard, it's Christmas Eve.
You can't be going to the office.
I have to pick up the D-O-L-L.
I left it there by mistake.
You can't go.
What about the parade?
The parade?
The Holiday Wintertainment Parade.
You didn't go last year,
or the year before.
Mom and I always go. This year
Turbo Man's gonna be there!
Yeah, Turbo Man.
"It's Turbo Time."
Dad, you can't miss it.
It'll be really cool.
I won't miss it.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Sorry about that, Howie.
What's that, a reindeer?
A surprise for Johnny.
You just think of everything,
don't you?
I believe you can never do too much
to make a child's Christmas magical.
What happens to Blitzen
after Christmas?
I've been watching
a family of deer by the lake.
I thought I'd take him down there
and set him free.
Maybe they'll take him in
like he's one of their own.
How touching.
Hey, how are you?
That's odd.
Reindeer are usually gentle.
There's something about you
he doesn't like.
Aftershave or something.
All right, got to go.
Where you off to?
Picking up a Christmas present
for Jamie.
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute.
What'd you get?
One of those Turbo Mans.
That's great.
I got a Turbo Man for Johnny
months ago.
It's nestled safely under our tree.
Good.
By the way, they say
it may get icy later.
You might want to wrap
some chains around those tires.
Maybe I should wrap
some chains around you.
What?
Come on.
What time do you open?
It's freezing out here.
There's 100 people...
Because of two minutes? Because of
two minutes you're not letting...
Give the man a break!
He's a dad, trying to get a toy!
Go ahead and have cuts.
Last-minute shopping?
Enough to drive a man insane.
Myron Larabee.
Howard Langston.
I'm late because it's the
busiest time of the year for me.
Christmas letters people send to
folks they talk to once a year.
And relatives sending gifts
they'll send back anyway.
How many toiletry kits
does a man need? Then what?
Stupid letters from kids to Santa!
"Dear Santa, can you send me a bike
and a Slinky?"
No! Your father's laid off!
As if I didn't have enough pressure,
my son sends me out...
...for some goofy toy, some fruity
robot named "Turtle Man."
Turbo Man.
My son wants one too.
You know it's all a ploy.
Man, don't you watch TV?!
We are being set up by
rich and powerful toy cartels!
These fat cats use the working class,
like me and you!
They spend billions of dollars on
advertisements...
...and use subliminal messages to
suck your children's minds out!
I know, I went to junior college.
And I studied psychology!
I know what's going on!
They make a kid feel like garbage
if you, the father...
...who works 24/7 delivering mail...
...to make alimony payments to a woman
who had everyone at the office...
...but me!
Then the toy breaks and you can't
fix it because it's cheap plastic!
I'd like to walk up in that office,
grab one of those guys and...
...choke him until his eyes pop out!
Shouldn't wear fur.
Back off! I'm first!
Turbo Man, you're mine!
Move it! Move it!
Get out of my way!
Who wants Booster?
The Turbo Man dolls,
they're all gone!
-There must be one.
-There are none!
-Excuse me.
-Yes?
-I need a Turbo Man.
-Me too.
Do you have any in back?
Why's he laughing?
Michael, these guys are looking
for a Turbo Man.
They're looking for Turbo Man.
Hey, everybody, these two
are looking for a Turbo Man.
Shut up!
Yeah, what's so funny?
Where have you guys been? Turbo Man's
only the hottest selling toy ever.
But we got plenty of Turbo Man's
saber-toothed tiger, Booster.
Where's your Christmas spirit?
That's better.
There must be a Turbo Man
here somewhere.
The last one just left.
A lady had it on layaway.
A lady? What lady?
Short...
...with a fur coat!
Sorry, buddy!
Give me this.
This is war.
Oh, poor baby!
Hey, lady!
Hey, hold it!
Wait!
Wait, lady!
I need that Turbo Man!
Wait!
I'm Turbo Man.
No, I am!
You're always Turbo Man.
-You be Dementor.
-Heck, no.
Cut it out.
-Hi, Liz.
-Oh, hi, Ted.
It's Christmas Eve and you're
slaving over a hot stove.
"Mom of the Year."
It's no big deal.
And modest too.
Looks like you could use
some "you time."
Go upstairs, take a bath. I'll watch
the boys, finish up with the cookies.
Go on.
You deserve it.
Well, okay, but, you know...
I know, sugar cookies.
Bake 1 2 to 1 5 minutes...
...till golden brown.
Ted's got everything under control!
Pipe down in there!
Merry Christmas!
Langston residence.
Howard! How's it going out there?
Everything okay?
Fine. I need to speak to Liz.
Could you get...?
Excuse me, but your wife's cookies
are out of this world.
What? Who told you
you can eat my cookies?
I'm just helping Liz out a little
in the kitchen.
I need to speak to my wife, so could
you get her on the phone, please?
She may be showering, should I check?
No!
I mean, no. It's fine.
On your way out, tell her
I will be a few minutes late.
But she shouldn't worry.
She won't. I mean, I'm here and...
Oh, these cookies! I gotta get
the recipe from Liz.
Put that cookie down!
Now!
Is something bothering you?
At Christmas there's
a high incidence of breakdowns.
There's the next batch.
I'll give Liz your message.
Hey, look who it is!
Still on the hunt?
Sorry about whacking you.
Got caught up in the friendly
spirit of competition.
That's all right.
I was thinking you'd have
done the same thing.
Then I realized we're the same
kind of person.
I doubt that.
Outside of the brouhaha in the store,
we could form a team.
You know, like Starsky and Hutch.
Like lke and Tina.
Maybe we could do it!
Search and destroy. Divide
and conquer! What do you say?
Thanks, Myron...
...but no, thank you.
Let's do it, man!
Let's be a team!
Gee, Myron, I think
you're a good guy and all...
...but this I would like
to do by myself.
You understand...
...right?
I understand you!
I know what's going on.
Mister, with your fancy cashmere coat
and little suede shoes.
I was good enough to talk to in line,
but not to be on your team!
That's racism! That's what
Jesse Jackson talks about.
They got a delivery of
Turbo Man at Toy Works!
-Turbo Man!
-Turbo Man!
Piece of junk!
Officer...
You broke my little mirror.
License and registration, please.
Is there a problem, officer?
Listen up, people!
As to your first question: Yes!
The rumors are true.
We have received a small quantity
of the Turbo Man action figure.
I'm not going to ask you people
to be quiet again!
Here's how this will work.
Form an orderly line so an employee
can hand you a numbered ball.
These balls...
...will then be drawn in lottery
fashion to see who gets a doll.
If you're not one of them...
...we have plenty of Turbo Man's
pet tiger, Booster, in stock.
We don't want it! We don't want it!
Who wants Booster?
In accordance with the laws
of supply and demand...
...the price of each
figure has doubled.
I got it! I got it!
-He maced me!
-I got it!
I got it! I got it!
He got two! He got two!
Get the mailman!
Get him!
He's lying!
That's my ball!
Rodney King! Rodney King!
This is my ball. Stay.
Hi, little girl.
Look what I've got.
A shiny red ball.
Want to trade?
Give me the ball!
Sicko! Pervert!
Get your hands off my kid!
I need the ball!
I need that toy!
I need that toy.
-Pervert!
-I'm not a pervert!
I just was looking for
Turbo Man doll!
Hey, come here.
Come here.
You want a Turbo Man?
Forget it. I'm not
gonna sit on your lap.
That's not my bag. Get it?
You know, little boy,
with your attitude...
...I don't think I'll
give you access to this.
Tony, show him.
That was taken this morning.
How do I know this isn't a scam?
Forget it, Tony.
He doesn't want our help.
Wait a minute, guys.
We're businessmen. I'm sure
we can work out an agreement.
You got cash, we got the doll.
How much?
Merry Christmas!
A Merry Christmas to you.
Are you crazy?
Santa doesn't deliver
in broad daylight.
Excuse me. I may be wrong...
...but you're not the real Santa.
Really? And you're not the kind
of guy who's got enough foresight...
...to get his kid a Turbo Man
before Christmas Eve.
Show a little respect
for the suit, huh?
Do you want the doll?
Come on, I got a parade to go to...
...and I haven't yet seen
this Turbo Man doll.
Hang a left.
He's a little boy
Who Santa Claus forgot
Beautiful.
Up here.
I love this time of year.
Christmas carols...
...snowflakes, Santa Clauses.
Now what?
Are you Dan Rather?
What are you, the question king?
Chill.
All right, keep your hands
where I can see them.
Password.
Jingle bells, Batman smells.
I know what you're thinking.
Oh, no.
You have no idea.
Tony, get the man his Turbo Man.
Got it.
I gotta tell you, Santa...
...there's something here
that doesn't seem quite...
...kosher.
Kosher?
This, coming from a guy who assaulted
a toddler for a superball?
Listen, we provide a service here.
We don't do this for us.
We do it for the kids.
For the kids?
For every kid who ever
sat down on Santa's lap.
Every little girl who left cookies
and milk for Santa on Christmas night.
Every boy who opens a gift Christmas
morning and finds clothes...
...instead of toys.
It breaks my heart.
There it is.
That'll be 300.
Dollars?
No, chocolate kisses!
Yes, dollars!
I can't believe this.
What happened to your lofty ideals?
I thought you did this for the kids.
Well, sure.
I don't see why we can't make
some money in the process.
Take it.
Count it.
Put it in the safe.
Don't open that up!
Well, that's
the multilingual version.
It's fun and educational.
I wouldn't...
Of course,
there's some assembly required.
Let me get that.
Put it in the box and...
Forget it. Give me the money back.
All sales are final.
You know what you are?
Nothing but a bunch of sleazy
con men in red suits.
What?
You heard me.
Con men, thieves, degenerates,
low-lifes, thugs, criminals!
In the North Pole,
them are fighting words, partner.
Put 'em up!
Relax, buddy.
I'm not about to hit a Santa Claus.
Are you chicken?
Get him!
Shut up!
I'm gonna deck your halls, bub.
Little buddy!
You're a naughty boy!
Who's gonna be next?
Dog pile!
It's the Grinch!
Scatter!
Who are you?
Hey, buddy!
This is the sloppiest bust
I've ever seen in my entire career.
Detective Lang, undercover.
I've been working on this case
for the last 3 years...
...and you come barging in here like a
bunch of terrorists at a tea party!
Wait till the commissioner finds out.
He's going to hit the roof!
Now get your act together
and arrest someone!
Go!
I'm not going back to the joint!
Put them in the van and lock them up!
Come on.
Come on, not now!
You're so considerate,
bringing all this holiday cheer.
Christmas comes but once a year.
You're an amazing man, Ted.
I wish every husband
was more like you.
Thanks. We should get together
and swap recipes.
What's the reindeer's name?
I named him Ted, after my dad.
Your dad is so cool. I wish
my dad did stuff like this.
He never used to. Not until
he and my mom split up.
Really?
Maybe your parents should get
a divorce. Did wonders for my dad.
Hot chocolate?
How you doing, buddy?
Hi, Dad. I knew you'd call.
Let me talk to your mom.
-You can't.
-Why not?
She's next door petting Ted.
She's what?
Are you on your way?
The parade's gonna start soon.
Get your mother.
-Are you?
-Am I what?
Coming home soon?
Yes, immediately.
Now please get your mother.
Before you left, you promised
that you'd be at the parade.
You haven't been here all day,
so you can't miss it.
Jamie, please...
'Cause when someone makes a promise,
they should keep it.
It's like what Turbo Man says:
"Always keep your promises if you want
to keep your friends."
Enough!
Enough of this Turbo Man, okay?
I've had it up to here.
If there's anyone I don't
want advice from, it's Turbo Man!
Now, get your mother.
I'm sorry, Jamie.
Look...
What would you know about
keeping your promises? You never do!
You never do anything you
say you're going to do!
Ever!
Damn you, Howard.
Here you go, my man.
This'll warm you up.
Cheers.
You!
Peace.
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Right.
Any luck finding the doll?
No.
Me neither.
Maybe this will help.
What the hell?
So I couldn't find the kid a doll.
Does that make me a bad father?
No.
But yelling at him
for no reason...
...that makes me a bad father.
We get one chance a year to prove
we're not screwups and what happens?
We screw it up.
I remember a few years ago...
...I wanted to do something
special for Jamie.
So...
...I built him his own clubhouse.
It came out great.
Well, I mean, the door
was a little crooked, right?
And the roof wasn't straight,
but you should've seen his face.
When he saw that, he was so excited.
We played in the clubhouse all day.
He even made us have dinner in it.
I was the hero then.
Look at me now.
He's gonna need serious therapy, man.
Don't say that.
I know what I'm talking about.
See, I never forgave my father.
One Christmas I wanted a special toy:
Johnny-7 OMA gun.
You remember those?
I remember the commercial.
Two kids playing in the back yard.
"Johnny to Peter, enemy sighted."
"Roger there. Open fire."
Then Johnny whips out his
Johnny-7 OMA gun. Seven guns in one.
Thing looked like a blast.
But, of course, with my old man...
...Christmas was just another
opportunity to let me down.
I never got the Johnny-7 OMA.
Sorry to hear that.
Don't mean nothing.
Ever heard of Scott Sherman?
Yeah, CEO of Sherman Industries.
He was my old neighbor...
...and his dad
got him a Johnny-7 OMA gun.
You know what happened?
He became a billionaire.
And me...
...well...
...l'm just a loser...
...with no future.
Here's to you, Dad.
I can't let this happen.
It's just a doll.
It's just a stupid
little plastic doll.
Action figure.
There's gotta be one somewhere!
You say you've been looking
everywhere for a Turbo Man doll?
You say you'd do just about
anything to get one?
KQRS has good news for you.
If you're the first caller to
identify Santa's reindeer...
...you'll get the hottest toy since
Johnny-7 OMA.
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,
Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.
I don't think so, buddy.
Come on.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone!
Come on, answer it.
KQRS, hello.
-I got the answer!
-No, you don't!
-Why did you do that?!
-9-1 -1! 9-1 -1!
I got through!
You guys, the radio station's just
2 blocks down, on Wabasha.
I got...
...the answer.
I got the answer.
Bye-bye! Sorry!
You barked up the wrong tree.
I can run like this for miles.
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,
Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.
I'm having a good time! Bye!
KQRS, you're on the air.
Randy, Jermaine, Tito...
No, not even close. Sorry.
Maybe this'll put us in the mood.
Let me in! I got the answer!
Open up!
I got the answer! I got the answer!
Open up!
I got a madman in my studio.
Help me!
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen!
I couldn't get you on the phone.
Did I win?
I won! I won!
No! Wait, wait, wait!
Too late. I already got
the right answer. I won.
I don't need the answer to win!
I got this!
What's that?
This, Mr. Track Star,
is a homemade explosive device!
A bomb?
Yes, in layman's terms...
...a bomb! So back up!
You built a bomb?
I didn't have to.
Don't you read the news?
These things come through
the mail every day! I kept one.
So give me the doll,
or I'll blow everyone up!
Are you crazy? Put this thing away!
It's not worth it!
To me it is! So back up!
Back up!
Come on, buddy.
Give me the package.
-Let's have it.
-Did you call me buddy?
I'm not your buddy!
I tried to be your teammate! Your
friend! But no, you had other plans.
I had no plans.
You are no different than the rest!
Those letter-writers who make fun
of my knee socks in the summer!
Are you laughing at me?
No, Lord, no. Not at all.
Mr. Ponytail Man, I know you!
I know your kind!
You put a trash can in front of the
mailbox so I gotta get out of my jeep.
No! I recycle.
-Shut up!
-Yeah, shut up!
Why's the window there?
So I can just put the mail in!
But you act like everything's okay!
Hey, Mr. Mailman!
Like I have no feelings of my own!
Hit the deck!
I'm sorry.
I've been under pressure.
Don't hit me! I got sickle cell!
Are you under the impression I have a
Turbo Man doll here in the studio?
-Yes.
-That's what you said on the radio.
-Yes, you did.
-No, no!
What I actually said was whoever won
would get a doll...
...eventually.
You see, what we have here...
...is a gift certificate.
A gift certificate?!
Right.
A certificate for a doll when
they get some in the stores.
-Did you call the cops?
-Kind of.
Let's get out of here.
But I'm first!
Better luck next time, loser!
Freeze!
Just can't stay
out of trouble, can you?
Don't hurt a fellow civil servant.
All this violence!
It's Christmas, and I was
just delivering some...
Back up! This is a
homemade explosive device.
I'll blow it up!
I work for the post office,
so you know I'm not stable!
Tell them!
This man is totally insane.
Thank you! Now put the guns down.
Now!
Brother, put your gun down!
Everybody!
You too, Barnaby Jones.
Just stay there.
I'll know if you move, because I have
the ear of a snake!
Ciao, baby.
You shouldn't touch that.
Relax, Sparky...
...I was on the bomb squad
for 10 years.
I'm the man! I'm the man!
Gentlemen...
...we've been duped.
This is nothing but a
harmless Christmas package.
That was really a bomb?
This is a sick world
we're living in!
How many years in the bomb squad?
Thanks a lot.
That son of a...
What are you doing?
Your star wasn't up.
It's Christmas Eve, it has to be up.
I'm out all day...
...and he's in my house...
...putting up my star...
...on my tree.
I got a Turbo Man for Johnny
months ago.
It's nestled safely under our tree.
Nestled safely under our tree.
Safely under our tree...
I'll show him.
I'm sorry, Ted,
but that's Howard's job.
He puts the star on.
He's adamant about it.
Too bad he's not adamant about
being with his family...
...on Christmas Eve.
It's Turbo Time!
Liz, do you hear that?
Carolers.
Let's go. Come on!
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
The back door.
Good tidings for Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
What am I doing?
Look at me.
Stealing from a kid.
I can't do this.
You're gonna go back.
Nice doggy.
Nice...
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Balthazar!
Howard?
What are you doing?
What's that?
You can always count on me!
That is Johnny's Turbo Man.
What?
It's not what you think.
It isn't? Really?
Then tell me. You said you got
Jamie a Turbo Man weeks ago.
It looks like you broke into
Ted's house and stole presents!
If you give me a second,
I could explain it.
I know parts of this are going
to sound completely ridiculous...
...but let me tell you the truth.
I've been listening to your version
of the truth for far too long.
All I want is to salvage what's
left of Christmas Eve...
...and go to the parade with my son.
Liz, please...
-Would you drive us?
-Of course.
You can't bench-press
your way out of this one.
Oh, God.
You picked the wrong day.
You started it.
Mom, do you think Dad's
going to be at the parade?
I wouldn't count on it.
Turbo Man's gonna be there.
You can always count on him.
Hey, Rudolph, can I
buy you another round?
Sorry, buddy...
...but you're on your own.
It's time I start
keeping my promises.
It's that time of year again.
The 1 2th Annual
Holiday Wintertainment Parade.
I'm Gale Force, here with the lovely
Liza Tisch of "AM Live."
Merry Christmas, Gale.
We're high atop Channel 29's
Parade Central...
...to keep you updated on all
of this year's parade action.
Let's watch...
And listen.
The parade's already started!
There's Owen and his dad.
Can we stand with them
while you park the car?
Please?
We'll meet you there.
And don't go wandering off.
Jamie, put on your hat.
I know.
Check it out!
You see Turbo Man?
No, they're saving him for last.
This is awesome!
Cat in the Hat!
Can't you take 4th Street?
Sorry, the roads are packed.
Everyone's going to the parade.
Turbo Man's gonna be there.
I know.
I'm sorry you had to go
through that back there.
Here, have some
non-alcoholic eggnog.
I'll be fine.
You can't hide your feelings from me.
Let it out.
Get it out of your system.
No, really, Ted, I'm okay.
I don't think so.
You're like a lost, frightened foal.
I can see it in your eyes.
Don't worry.
Ted's here.
That's...
...very sweet.
You deserve better, Lizzie.
"Lizzie"?
Someone you can talk to.
A shoulder to cry on.
It's useless, Liz. We can't
hide our feelings any longer.
Feelings?
I don't have to tell you...
...l'm a very eligible bachelor.
Lots of women would give anything
to be in your position.
Well, I'm a lucky, lucky girl.
For me, it all started
months ago...
...at your Labor Day
barbecue, remember?
And you asked me
how to marinate ahi tuna?
And I said, "All you need
is ltalian salad dressing."
You!
Stop that man!
Enough talking.
That didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.
You!
Who are you? Are you the guy?
Thank God. We got him, people!
Listen. We're running late,
so pay attention.
We sent you an instruction manual
so you know the important controls.
I'll go over the changes. There are
three cutoff valves to the nitro.
Here, here, here.
The reading on the pressure
gauge should be below 50.
Not 70, like we told you earlier.
The emergency cutoff is here.
The primary controls are here.
There's a microphone inside the
helmet to alter your voice properly.
Procedure-wise, it's
the same as we talked about.
Stick to that,
there'll be no problems.
Questions?
Before you say anything,
I speak for everyone...
...when I thank you for filling in.
It was a total freak accident,
what happened at rehearsal.
We're confident we got
all the kinks out.
You should know the doctor said Pete
showed some brain activity today.
That's a really good sign.
Let's move it out, people!
Finally!
Where the hell have you been?
I've been sweating like a dog
in a Chinese restaurant...
...waiting for your
sorry ass to show up!
Well...
...it's showtime!
I know you.
You're Booster.
And who the hell do you think
you are, Mary Poppins?!
Come on, come on, let's go!
Wait. Let's talk!
Have a great show!
And now...
...the moment you've all
been waiting for!
Live and in person...
...Turbo Man!
Wave, you idiot!
Wave!
This is cool.
Look, Mom, it's Turbo Man!
I could get into this.
In a few moments Turbo Man will pick
a special child from the audience.
That child will be the winner of a
special edition Turbo Man doll.
You're supposed to be
holding this.
Hey, rock star!
Be on your toes. Dementor's gonna
jump on the float soon.
What's he doing?
Would you pick a kid already?
Pick a kid?
Pick a kid so he can come
up here and get his prize!
Pick me! Pick me!
Over here!
-He's looking at me.
-No, me.
-He's pointing at me.
-No, me.
Me!
Me!
Jamie.
He knows my name!
I think Turbo Man
has selected a winner.
Go ahead.
Go, Jamie!
Merry Christmas, Jamie.
How did you know my name?
Well, Jamie...
...you see...
...l'm your fa...
Oh, no, kids!
It's Turbo Man's archenemy...
...Dementor!
Shut up!
Was that in the script?
All right, give me the doll
and nobody gets hurt!
Myron?
That's right, Turtle Man.
Thought you could outsmart me?
Thought your suit idea
was so slick!
But you know what?
I'm one step ahead of you
because I have a bigger brain!
Just stay here.
Come on, Myron.
You're taking this too far.
I'm not going home
without that doll!
Hey, this ain't
the way we rehearsed it!
You know what?
Nobody likes you, Booster.
We don't like you!
We hate you, Booster!
Where are you going?
Come back, my little pretty,
and your little doll too!
Hey, Myron!
Leave him alone!
Ta-ta, Turtle Man!
Uh-oh, Liza! It looks like
Dementor has beaten Turbo Man.
This could be the end
of civilization as we know it.
Do something, Turbo Man!
Use your Turbo Disks!
My what?
On your arm!
Hey, man! I have a
special delivery for you!
It appears that Turbo Man
has saved the day.
I'll take you back to your mom.
Go, Demon Team!
It's the Demon Team,
Dementor's evil henchmen!
What'll you do now?
What about my son?
Don't you know the choreography?
I ain't through with you!
Get out of my way!
Come here.
I'm sorry I hollered!
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Come here, boy!
Get this popcorn away!
You know what?
You need a time-out.
Don't worry, it's part of the show.
Stay on the sidewalk.
That's my son.
Oh, he's wonderful.
He's not part of the show!
I'm scared of heights.
You ever see the movie Vertigo?
Let's get him!
I want to talk to you!
All right, kid, end of the line!
Give me the doll!
Never!
Fly, Turbo Man! Use your jet pack!
It's Turbo Time!
I think I'm getting the hang of this!
Turbo Man, help!
I got you!
Out of my way!
Let us pray.
I got you, kid!
Give me the doll.
Turbo Man!
Use your Turbo-rang!
Come on!
Missed me!
Victory is mine!
V-l-C-T-O-R-Y!
I got it! I got one!
I finally got one!
Turbo Man! Help!
Got you!
Thanks, Turbo Man.
I knew you'd save me.
You can always count on me.
Awesome!
Here you go, ma'am.
Did you see that?
I was flying with Turbo Man!
He saved me from Dementor.
It was the coolest! Did you see?
I saw. I saw.
Thank you. You don't know
how much he means to me.
Oh, I think I have an idea.
What's the matter?
It's just... I wish Dad
could've been here, you know?
To see me fly and all.
But he didn't come.
And it's all my fault.
He's mad at me.
We had a fight on the phone
and I kind of yelled at him.
Your dad is not mad at you.
He loves you more
than anything in the world.
You're his all-time
favorite person!
How do you know that?
Well, who would know better than...
...me?
Dad?
Howard?
Right here.
You two mean more to me
than anything.
I'm sorry I haven't
shown that lately.
I know I've been
neglecting both of you.
But no more.
I love you. I love you both!
What's going on here?
Jamie's dad is Turbo Man!
Let's get out of here!
You smell like barf!
Young man, I have something
that belongs to you.
Thanks!
You're welcome.
As for you...
...we could use
a man like you on the force.
Thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.
I'm sorry about the bike.
And the coffee.
And the bus.
And the...
...bomb.
Bomb?
I had it right here in my hands.
What do I tell my son
on Christmas morning?
How will I look him in the eye?
Wait!
Did you see? I had it!
I was so close.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you. Thank you!
This'll make my son really happy.
I'm sorry about that
tension on the roof.
It's cool.
But, Jamie, I thought you wanted
this doll more than anything.
What do I need the doll for?
I got the real Turbo Man at home.
Turbo Man!
That's my husband.
Turbo Man!
That's my dad!
That's my dad!
Look at that. There it is!
Beautiful.
Perfecto!
I've been thinking.
Everything you went through today
shows how much you love Jamie.
And if you're willing to go through
all of that just for a present...
...that makes me wonder...
What?
What did you get me?




The Santa Clause

          Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

          Hey, guys!

            - Ho! Merry Christmas. - Thanks. - Hey!

            Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?

            This has been our best year ever thanks to Do-lt-All-For-You-Dolly.

            A-And I think we should give a special thanks to the people...

            responsible for our record-breaking sales,

            our Midwest marketing and distribution team,

            - Scott Calvin and Susan Perry! - Yeah!

            Let's hear it for 'em! Come on!

            Susan, darling, come on up here. Aren't they adorable?

            Say a few words.

            Thank you very much. This was really a team effort,

            and I would just want to thank every one of you individually--

            But we don't have time for that, do we?

            In all seriousness, um, here at B&R Toys,

            we're not just about makin' a profit in quality toys.

            We're also about families.

            But our families aren't here with us right now.

            Which is probably why Johnson's secretary is sittin' in his lap.

            You guys have a great party, have a great year.

            Drive safe. Thanks very much.

            Aren't they wonderful?

            Laura, I was hopin' to catch you before you'd left your house.

            I ran real late today. You wouldn't believe the traffic out here.

            Yeah, same to you! And that's not very ladylike!

            Anyway, I'll try to get to my house as soon as I can.

            Oh, there's the problem right there.

            Three car pile-up. I'm really gonna be late.

            Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells All seem to sing throw cares away

            Christmas is here bringing good cheer To young and old, meek and the bold

            Ding dong and dong, balance in song Ring joyful ring, all caroling

            One seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere filling the air

            Oh, how they pound, raising the sound go hand in hand calling in the town

            Gaily they ring while people sing songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

            Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas

            Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas

            On we will sing, dawn with a hymn Angel will come to every home

            Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells All seem to sing throw cares away

            Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells one seems to hear words of good cheer

            From everywhere, filling the air Oh, how they pound, raising the sound

            Go hand in hand Calling in the town

            Gaily they ring while people sing songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

            Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas

            Merry, merry, merry merry Christmas

            On we will sing, dawn with a hymn Angel will come to every home

            On we will sing, dawn with a hymn Angel will come to every home

            Ding dong ding

            Dong

            All right. Let's go.

            - Bye, Charlie. - Bye, Neal.

            - Oh, sorry I'm late. Hi. - Hi.

            - Did you want to come in for a minute? - Neal's waiting in the car, so--

            - Why doesn't he come in? - 'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll just end up saying something snotty.

            Not necessarily. Could be rude or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.

            - See? I gotta go. Here. - Oh, come on. Come on.

            Christmas Eve. Just for a minute.

            Watch those steps. They're real slippery.

            - Ooh! - Told ya.

            - So-- - Well--

            - You goin' to your mom's for dinner? - Actually, we're gonna be with Neal's family.

            Ah, Christmas at the pound.

            There aren't that many presents over there.

            Well, that's because Santa isn't here yet.

            Neal doesn't believe in Santa.

            Well, Neal's head comes to a point.

            -He's smart. He's a doctor. -He's not a doctor. He's a psychiatrist.

            Take your coat off. You're stickin' around, aren't ya?

            I'll be right there. Just a sec.

            - I just want to-- - Did that jerk tell Charlie there was no Santa Claus?

            What? No. Oh, Charlie came home from school the other day in tears,

            because some big kid told him there was no such thing as Santa.

            And, you know Neal. Well, he sat him down and--

            He told him that there was a Santa Claus.

            Well, all he said was that Santa was more like a feeling.

            You know, more like a state of mind than a person.

            Kind of like Neal. And who gave you permission to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?

            I think if we're gonna destroy our son's illusions, I should be a part of it.

            - Yeah, but you're never around, are you, Scott? - Oh, oh, please.

            Listen, all we are trying to do is give Charlie a firm grasp on reality.

            That's a good idea. You don't want kids runnin' around usin' their imaginations.

            Oh, yeah. This from the guy responsible for the Do-lt-All-For-You-Dolly.

            - Leave her out of this. - Don't you burp me, don't you change me

            - I'm the dolly-- - Why do you guys always have to fight?

            I, uh, swear we're not fighting. It's your mom's singing.

            It sounds a lot like fighting, doesn't it? Cats even.

            The trouble is, Neal and your mom, they don't believe in Santa because they were real naughty.

            Which is why they'll probably get lumps of coal in their stockings.

            I don't know. It seems kind of babyish to believe in that kind of stuff.

            What are you talkin' about? I believe in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.

            - Well-- - Maybe it's time you left.

            We don't want to keep Dr Pinhead waiting.

            Come here.

            Do I gotta stay?

            Listen, you and your daddy are gonna have a great Christmas, okay?

            - Will you pick me up tomorrow? - Of course.

            - Early? - Yes.

            We're talking sunup? You're here?

            You'll be fine. Ah, merry Christmas, Charlie. I love you.

            I love you too, Mom.

            - You be a good boy, okay? - Bye, Mom.

            Four hours?

              I'm dreamin' of a white Christmas

              - Your Christmas will be perfect-- - Just like the ones I used to know

              ...with its own built-in turkey timer.

              Where those treetops glisten

              -And now, we return to the most cherished of Christmas stories, -And children listen

              - Miracle On   th Street, starring Natalie Wood and-- - To hear sleigh bells in the snow--

              That is exactly why you want a high-quality fire extinguisher right in the kitchen.

              Those flames were really big, Dad.

              - Yeah, turkey's funny that way. - Dad!

              'Ey!

              It's done.

              You like osso buco, Charlie? They're closed.

              You know, Neal's a real good cook.

              Yeah, and you should see him walk on water.

              - You don't like him very much, do ya, Dad? - Charlie, yeah--

              I was joking, okay? I'm sorry. I was just kiddin' around.

              I like him a lo-- Yeah, sure, I like him. You know, there--

              There's just something about him that makes me wanna--

              Lash out irrationally?

              - Where did you hear that? - From Neal.

              I learn a lot from him. He listens to me.

              Yeah. Then he charges ya for it.

              I'm dreaming

              - Of a white Christmas - All right. Denny's.

              - Just like the ones I used to know - It's always open. - I don't wanna eat here.

              - What are you talkin' about? Everybody likes Denny's. - Where those treetops

              - It's an American institution. - Glisten

              - Are you with Hatsutashi? - No!

              - Dad burnt the turkey. - Oh, yeah. This way. Come on.

              - Right over there. - Thank you.

              - Here we go. - Burn the turkey?

              - Coffee? - No, thank you, Judy.

              What do you say we start out with cold glasses...

              of delicious seasonal favourite eggnog?

              - I don't like eggnog. - We're out.

              - Coffee. Decaf. - Mm-hmm.

              - I'll have chocolate milk, please. - We're out.

              - Plain milk's fine. - Okay.

              - At least we know they got hot apple pie. - We did.

              Mm-hmm!

              This is nice.

              "And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap...

              - I'm dreaming - "had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

              - Of a white - "When out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,

              - Christmas - "l sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

              "Away to the window I flew like a flash.

              "With a miniature sleigh and St. Nich-- and Prancer and Dancer--

              ...and to all a good night."

              - What's that? - What's what?

              "A Rose Suchak ladder"?

              It's not a ladder. I said, "arose such a clatter."

              It means, eh, "came a big noise."

              What?

              Charlie, "arose" is a word that means "it came,"

              and "clatter" is a big noise.

              Now, please, go to sleep. Shut your eyes.

              How do reindeer fly? They don't have any wings.

              - Fairy dust? - That's from Peter Pan, Dad.

              - Horns. - Antlers.

              Whatever. Their, uh, antlers give them--

              You know, ther-- ther-- there's a slipstream effect-- The air go--

              T-They move fa-- They're weightless.

              - But if Santa's so fat, how did he get down the chimneys? - He sucks it in like Grandpa.

              But what about people who don't have fireplaces? How does he get into their house?

              Charlie, sometimes believing in something means you--

              means you just believe in it.

              Santa uses reindeer to fly because that's how he has to get around.

              But you do believe in Santa, right, Dad?

              Of course I believe in Santa. Now, please, go to sleep.

              - Dad? - What is it, Charlie?

              Maybe you better leave some cookies and milk out, just in case, okay?

              Great. I'll just go preheat the oven.

              And don't forget the fire extinguisher.

              Good night, Charlie.

              Ho!

              Now, settle down there.

              Dad! Dad!

              - W-What? - I heard a clatter.

              - What, Charlie? - There! A clatter!

              - Charlie, what are you talkin' about? - You know, "it came a big noise."

              It's coming from outside.

              Charlie, it's just the wind or somethin'.

              Come on. Let's go back to bed.

              - Somebody's on the roof. - Maybe it's Santa.

              Not now, Charlie. I want you to sit here, and I want you to stay right there.

              - Charlie, do you know how to call    ? - Sure.    .

              Yeah. Great. Stay there.

              - Hey, you! - What's that--

              Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

              Whoo-hoo! Hey, buddy.

              All right, you should just stay still. Perfect.

              - You got him! - Charlie, stay where you are.

              Charlie, would you listen to me? Stay up there!

              It is Santa! You killed him.

              Did not. And he's not Santa.

              Well, he was.

              He's got some l.D. on him, I bet.

              Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just lookin' for your identification.

              Once I figure out who ya are, I'll-- I'll give you a lift back to the mall.

              "lf something should happen to me, put on my suit. The reindeer will know what to do."

              Yeah, right.

              Whoa.

              - Dad! - Hey.

              He disappeared.

              - Whoa! - He's naked somewhere.

              - You gonna put on the suit like the card said? Are you? - No. No.

              - Come on, Dad. I wanna go too. - Stop it, Charlie. We're not goin' anywhere.

              - You never do what I wanna do! - Would you please be quiet for a minute so I can figure this out?

              Reindeer up on the roof. Santa suit layin' on the ground.

              Guy fell. Not my fault.

              Reindeer on the roof. That is hard to explain.

              It's the ladder.

              Where the hell'd this come from?

              Look here, Dad. "The Rose Suchak Ladder Company."

              - Huh? - "Out by the roof there's a Rose Suchak ladder."

              - Just like the poem. - Just like the poem?

              Charlie, come on down from there. Charlie, get down from there!

              Dad! You gotta see this!

              - Don't touch anything! - It's great!

              I'm just gonna call the police. I'll carry this stuff up there. Let them deal with it, okay?

              Whoa! This guy was huge.

              Dad, isn't this neat?

              Charlie. Charlie! Stay away from those things.

              They're reindeer. You don't know where they've been.

              They all look like they've got key lime disease.

              Easy, Rudolph.

              Excuse me, Comet.

              Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh.

              There's no such thing as Santa's sleigh.

              - Sure there is. You said you believed in Santa, right? - I did? I do.

              What about the reindeer? These are Santa's reindeer, aren't they?

              I hope not. These are, uh,

              a gift.

              Probably from the cable company.

              We're getting the Disney Channel now. Merry Christmas.

              - Now, hop out of there, please. - I don't wanna go.

              Listen, Charlie. I'm not kidding. Let's go!

              - Whoa! Whoa! - Yeah! Let's go! Whoa!

              Charlie! Hold on, Charlie!

              Whoa!

              Giddyap, Comet! Whoa, let's go!

              Dad! Climb up here!

              There we go!

              So, uh, if we go straight on this road, and we hit l-  --

              Well, we made good time. Now what do we do?

              - Get the bag of toys. - And do what?

              - Go down the chimney. - Down the chimney?

              You want me to take the toys down the chimney...

              into a strange house in my underwear?

              No. You gotta put the suit on first.

              You know what we're gonna do is we're gonna get outta here,

              because this whole thing is stupid.

              How come everything I wanna do is stupid?

              I didn't say that.

              Freezing my nubs off out here, and you want me to get into a Santa costume.

              This is great. A Santa costume.

              Oh, this thing. You never know where it's been.

              A thousand malls.

              Well, I hope you're happy, Comet. Hope you're happy. But most of all,

              I hope the guy that lives here is a tailor!

              Nice coat.

              Well, how do I look? Nice?

              - You forgot the sash. - You're right.

              This completes the ensemble.

              All right. Got my boots.

              Now I've got the suit on. How am I supposed to know what to leave?

              - Maybe there's a list. - A list. How silly of me.

              Of course there's a list.

              Careful, Dad!

              - I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay! - Look! You're flying!

              It's okay. I'm used to it. I lived through the '  s.

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!

              Nice teeth.

              Who's down there?

              It's the holidays. Come on. Come on.

              Charlie, I need a little help down here!

              Whoa! How'd you do that? What'd it feel like, Dad?

              It felt like America's Most Wanted.

              Now, pull me in, quick. We gotta get outta here.

              Thanks. We gotta go home. How do you start this thing?

              Just like that!

              Whoa!

              This could be a really long night.

              Do it again, Dad. Please.

              I can't. That thing's empty.

              There's nothin' in the bag.

              Even if there was, d-didn't you notice there's no chimney?

              Where there's no chimney, there's no fireplace.

              Are you growling at me?

              Look, Comet, like I said,

              there is nothing left--

              That's so weird, 'cause I know when I did-- that--

              No, no, no, no, no! Hold it!

              There's no chimney here. Can you hear me? No chimney, all right?

              Lookin' good, Dad.

              You have got to be kidding! Come on!

              Look at the size of this thing.

              Weird! Ow!

              Ouch! Oh!

              - Santa? - Scott Calvin.

              How come your clothes are so baggy?

              Because Santa is watchin' his saturated fats.

              - How come you don't have a beard? - Because I shaved!

              Do you want this doll or not? Go back to sleep.

              You're supposed to drink the milk.

              Look, I am lactose intolerant.

              And I am just about this close to taking all those presents back up the chimney with me.

              "Supposed to drink the milk."

              Shut your eyes.

              Yo!

              How do you get in without a fireplace?

              I don't know. One just kind of appeared.

              Awesome!

              Oh, boy!

              Charlie, look at the clouds over here. Aren't they pret--

              Charlie!

              All right. Mornin', fellas.

              Mornin', sport. We're done, Comet. Ho-ho-ho.

              Back to the house.

              Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

              When I wake up, I'm gettin' a CAT scan!

              - Is this okay, Dad? - No, it's not okay!

              Hey, does this look like home to you guys?

              No, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey!

              Where you goin'? Come back here! Aww!

              In the silence of the night

              - When the snow - Hey, hey!

              - Lies soft and still - Hey, buddy!

              - You, sir! Hey! - You can see a magic light

              And hear the ring of Christmas bells

              - Can you hear me? - Though the night seems long and dark

              - It is the earth - What's that?

              - Just gone to sleep - I don't know.

              - I think it's the North Pole. - The stars that dot

              - That's the North Pole? - The sky above

              - Hey, buddy, we need some help. - Hold you in

              - Hello! - Their precious keep

              - What are you doing? - So close your eyes and come with me

              The Christmas bells will bring you home

              Hey, look! Here comes the new Santa!

              And now with song we fill the night

              While magic dances in the light

              To wish you now and all the year

              The joy that comes with Christmas cheer

              - Sit back. - Hear our voices fill the air

              To drive the winter's cold away

              And so our hearts with all will share

              The love that comes with Christmas day

              The love that comes with Christmas day

              The Christmas bells will bring you home

              - Where are all the grown-ups? - This is so cool.

              Stay here.

              Hey, kid, kid. Kid, who's in charge here?

              You are. And I'm not a kid. I've pointy shoes that are older than you.

              I'm an elf.

              Uh, you guys, or you girls-- Who gives the orders? Who's your boss?

              - You are. - No, no, no. Uh--

              - W-Who's the head elf? - You are.

              Hey! Who's causin' all the trouble around here?

              - He is. - She is.

              Excuse me. Are we on a coffee break?

              -We don't drink coffee. -Then I guess the break is over!

              Back to work. Thanks.

              Take it easy on her, will ya? Who are you?

              I'm Bernard. Nice to meet ya, Santa.

              I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night. There's been dogs barkin', guns goin' off.

              Look, my back's killin' me. Have you ever tried to shove a sea kayak down a chimney?

              - I'm tired of this small talk. - Hmm?

              The other Santa disappeared, right?

              Wait a minute. Hey, I know where this is goin'.

              It wasn't my fault. The other guy fell. It was an accident.

              I've got homeowner's insurance and a good attorney.

              Not as good as my wife's, but let's not open up that wound.

              Hold it a minute. Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

              How did you know the other guy was gone?

              - Can I get you a drink? - No, I don't want a drink.

              I'm thirsty and hungry too.

              Charlie, I thought I told you to stay in the sleigh.

              -Who's this? -This-- This is my son, Charlie.

              I'm sorry. Charlie, this is Buh, Beh, Beh--

              - Bernard. - Bernard.

              - Hi, Bernard. - Hiya, sport.

              - Hey, Dad, he called me "sport" just like you. - Wonderful.

              Hey, you know what. I got somethin' for you.

              Okay, now hold out your hand, all right?

              Now, be very careful. This is very old, just like me.

              Shake it up, Charlie.

              Wow.

              Why don't you, uh, hold onto it for me for a while.

              - It might come in handy. - Thanks. Thanks a lot.

              I promise I'll take real good care of it.

              - Make sure you do. - I will.

              Hey, Dad, look!

              Huh. Fabulous ball.

              - Hey, Barabbas. - Bernard!

              Bernard. Can we take a direct flight back to reality, or do we have to change planes in Denver?

              Uh, Larry, take Charlie here and get him some chow.

              - No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie! - He'll be okay.

              Follow me. You'll want to get out of those clothes.

              I-- Uh-- No, look, Barnaby, I just wanna go home.

              Look, I am not Santa Claus! Ahh!

              Did you or did you not read the card?

              - Yeah, I read the card. - Then you're the new Santa.

              In putting on the hat and jacket you accepted the contract.

              - What contract? - The card in the Santa suit. You said you read it, right?

              So when you put on the suit, you fell subject to the Santa Clause.

              - Here. - The Santa Claus?

              Oh, you mean the guy that fell off my roof?

              No, no, no, not Santa Claus, the person. Santa Clause, the clause.

              What?

              - Look, you're-- you're a businessman, right? - Yeah.

              Okay. A clause, as in the last line of a contract.

              - You got the card? - Oh!

              Okay, look.

              The Santa Clause: "ln putting on this suit and entering the sleigh...

              "the wearer waives any and all rights to any previous identity, real or implied,

              "and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus...

              "in perpetuity until such time that wearer becomes unable to do so...

              by either accident or design."

              - What does that mean? - It means you put on the suit, you're the big guy.

              - That's ridiculous. I didn't put on the suit just to-- - Try to understand this!

              Oo-oo-ooh!

              Let me explain something to you, okay?

              Toys have to be delivered. I'm not gonna do it. It's not my job. I'm just an elf.

              It's Santa's job, but Santa fell off a roof, your roof.

              You read the card, you put on the suit. That clearly falls under the Santa Clause.

              - So now you're Santa, okay? - A question.

              - What? - When can I get outta here?

              - Dad, you gotta see this place. - You leave tomorrow morning.

              You have    months to get your affairs in order, and you're due back here Thanksgiving.

              - I'm not comin' back here on Thanksgiving. - I'll ship the list to your house.

              - What list? - Come on, now. The list.

              - He's makin' a list - Checkin' it twice

              Gonna find out who's naughty or nice

              Look, you put a "P" next to the kids who are nice and a "C" next to the naughty ones.

              - "P" and "C"? - Yeah. "P" for present, "C" for coal, right, Bernard?

              - Right. - Wait a minute. How do I know who's good and bad?

              - You'll know. - What if I don't want to do this?

              -Don't even kid about a thing like that. -Why not?

              What if I don't buy into this Santa Clause thing? What if I choose not to believe it?

              Then there would be millions of disappointed children around the world.

              You see, children hold the spirit of Christmas within their hearts.

              You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas,

              now, would you, Santa?

              Judy will take you to your room. Get out of the suit. It needs to be cleaned.

              - And taken in. - Then get some sleep.

              We've got a lot of work to do and only a year in which to do it.

              - Judy. - Santa.

              - Scott Calvin. - Follow me.

              - I'll just take the next train. - Dad, come on!

              Charlie!

              - Come on, Dad! - Charlie, wait up!

              - That's funny. I like that. - I like that too. But I don't like--

              Wow!

              Can I get you anything? The kitchen's always open.

              How about a stiff drink?

              You should get some sleep.

              Here are your pyjamas. I'll be right back.

              Oh, oh, look, Judy. Look. Look over there.

              There's a--

              Look. Look over there. I know.

              Look. Look over there. There's a canoe. Aha, it's true.

              Oh, look, there's an emu.

              - Look at him. - Shoo.

              - Santa? - Scott Calvin.

              - I brought you some cocoa. - No, thanks.

              My own recipe. Took me      years to get it right.

              -      years? - That's right.

              You know, I must say, you look pretty good for your age.

              Thanks, but I'm seeing someone in wrapping.

              This is good.

              This is really good.

              Not too hot, extra chocolate, shaken, not stirred.

              You look distressed.

              Distressed? I'm way past distressed.

              - Why's that? - I'm talking to an elf.

              And I stopped believing in Santa Claus a long time ago.

              That's not surprising. Most grown-ups can't believe in magic.

              It just... sort of grows out of them.

              Look, you're a nice little elf.

              - Thanks. - But this is a dream.

              I mean, this is fabulous.

              Is that a polar bear directin' traffic down there?

              I-- I see it, but I don't believe it.

              - You're missing the point. - What is the point?

              Seeing isn't believing: believing is seeing.

              Kids don't have to see this place to know that it's here.

              They just... know.

              Well, you should get some rest. Good night, sir.

              Dad!

              Dad!

              Wake up, sleepy!

              Come on, get up!

              Dad!

              Dad!

              Dad!

              Come on, Dad! Come on!

              You should see all the neat toys.

              - Stop shakin' me, Charlie. - Come on. Get up. Get up!

              - Okay! - Come on. It's Christmas morning.

              - Great! G-Go and make some coffee. - Come on, Dad. Let's go!

              Okay. Okay.

              - Are you okay, Dad? - Yeah. Just fine. Just fine.

              Are you having a heart attack? I know CPR.

              No, I was just--

              - S.C.? - Yeah, Santa Claus.

              Hey. Same initials as your name, Dad.

              Scott Calvin.

              What?

              Oh, Charlie! Oh, merry Christmas, honey!

              - Did you have a good time? - Great time! The best!

              Great-- Oh, ho, Scott. Nice P.J.s. Very festive.

              - Where'd you get them? - I don't know.

              - Judy gave them to you. - Judy. Really.

              - Who? - Up in the North Pole.

              Ah, one of Santa's little helpers.

              Last night, Dad and me went with the flying reindeer.

              It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa, and Larry showed me the workshop.

              -You know, where they make all the toys? -Gee, thanks for...

              - keeping his feet on the ground. - You bet.

              Honey, you go wait in the car for a minute, okay? I'll be right there.

              - Merry Christmas. - Bye, Dad. Thanks for a great night at the North Pole.

              So, uh, what have you been telling him?

              Nothing. It's just... I had this really strange dream.

              And l-- I must have told him all about it.

              Wait!

              - Charlie. - Scott. - Hi, Dad.

              - Nice jammies. - Thanks. About what you said in the house.

              - Who showed you the workshop? - The elf.

              - How'd I get the pyjamas? - I told you. Judy.

              Oh, wait. Wait. Judy was the name of the waitress at the restaurant last night.

              - Some waitress gave you pyjamas? - What's this all about?

              Dad took me to the North Pole, and Larry showed me the workshop.

              - The North Pole. - Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.

              The regular Santa fell off the roof, and Dad put on the suit.

              Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.

              The clause. The Santa Clause.

              It's just a dream. Stuff like that doesn't happen.

              It was a dream. Come on!

              I don't even wear pyjamas! Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked.

              Ha! Morning, Mrs McGloin. Mary Catherine.

              Eyes front, Mary Catherine.

              Sometimes boxer shorts. You know.

              So, remember, kids, there is nothing more painful than third degree burns.

              Well, thank you, Fireman O'Hara.

              And I think the whole class will join me in saying...

              sorry about your partner.

              Well, perhaps this is a good time to bring up the psychiatrist.

              Charlie, would you like to introduce your, um--

              Dr Miller?

              Can I ask Dad to go first?

              Well, if that's how you feel, Charlie.

              That's how he feels, Neal. Come on. Nice sweater, buddy.

              This is my dad, Scott Calvin. He's got a really neat job.

              - Thank you, Charlie. - My dad is Santa Claus.

              Oh, boy! I think what he means is, I'm like Santa Claus.

              We're both giving. We're both jolly.

              And we both work very hard one day a year.

              - Oh, boy. - That's not what I mean, Dad.

              Look, on Christmas Eve, my dad pushed Santa off the roof.

              - No, Charlie-- Ch-- Charlie. - Santa disappeared and my dad took his place.

              - Charlie! - Then I went with him to deliver all the presents.

              Then the reindeer flew us to the North Pole where the head elf,

              - Charlie. - Bernard, gave me this.

              Look, I work for a toy company. I deliver toys all over the country.

              So, in a way, I'm like Santa Claus.

              - Yes, sweetheart? - Do you make the toys?

              No, stupid, the elves do!

              Bobby, we don't say "stupid," and we don't say "elves." They're little people.

              - No, but they really are elves. - Whatever, honey.

              - Which one's your favourite reindeer? - Comet.

              Uh, l, l, I don't have a favourite.

              So, let me get this straight, Santa.

              You mean, when I grow up, if I wanna be Santa Claus,

              all I gotta do is push you off a roof?

              All right, he said that. He said that it was the best Christmas he ever had.

              - Oh, big surprise. What do you think? - It's just nice to hear it from him.

              - Is that a problem with you? - That's my responsibility, isn't it? - All right. So?

              May I speak, please? I am a doctor.

              No, he's not. He's a psychiatrist.

              Please. Go ahead, Dr Miller.

              I guess we know who's the teacher's pet.

              Scott! Oh, grow up.

              The reason we're here is that this is far more serious...

              than a boy believing or not believing in Santa Claus.

              That's right, because Charlie thinks that this whole thing actually happened.

              Scott, what was the last thing you and Charlie did...

              before you went to bed Christmas Eve?

              We shared a bowl of sugar: did some shots of brown liquor:

              played with my shotguns: field dressed a cat:

              Iooked for women.

              - I read him a book. - What book?

              Uh, Hollywood Wives.

              The Night Before Christmas, folks. Come on!

              And did you go to the North Pole?

              T-This is ridiculous. I don't have time for this.

              Ridiculous or not, Scott, for Charlie, this isn't some dream.

              It is real.

              You need to sit down with Charlie. Explain to him...

              you are not Santa Claus.

              They're like the bears at the North Pole, Dad.

              Charlie, I already told ya. We did not go to the North Pole.

              - That was a dream. - You're in denial, Dad.

              Denial. You don't even know what that means.

              Well, you are. I know what happened.

              How do you know that? How? You don't have any proof.

              - Proof? - Why can't we both think of it as just a great dream and forget about it?

              What about this? Remember all the neat stuff inside?

              Charlie, this is a toy.

              We used to make things like this at work, but no one bought 'em.

              Here. I don't wanna talk about this any more.

              I know who you are, Dad. You'll figure it out soon enough.

              There are a lot of kids that believe in you. You can't let them down.

              Charlie, you're wrong.

              - What's so funny? - Nothing.

              He sees you when you're sleeping

              He knows when you're awake

              He knows if you've been bad or good

              Rollin' Keep those reindeer rollin'

              Okay, you better watch out You better not cry

              -You better not pout I'm tellin' you why -Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.

              - Santa Claus is coming - Whoa! We can't stop.

              - To town - But I have to go to the bathroom.

              I told you, you should've gone before we left the North Pole.

              And rummy tum-tums

              Whoa! Right here. Turn over here.

              Curly-haired dolls that toddle and coo

              Elephant spokes and kiddie cars too

              - Where is he? - Well, he could be in his room,

              jumping up and down on his bed wearing a red hat and galoshes.

              I don't care what Neal's doing. Where's Charlie?

              Oh, ho, ho. Oh, I see, I see.

              Well, if you can't be father of the year, why not be Father Christmas, huh?

              Charlie, it's just not logical.

              How can one man in one night...

              visit all the children of the world?

              Not everyone celebrates Christmas.

              And I think there's some sort of time continuum that breaks down once Santa's in his sleigh.

              What about fireplaces? A lot of people don't have them.

              How does Santa visit those people?

              He turns into Jell-O and--

              The fireplace kind of appears, and he goes through it like this.

              What about the reindeer?

              - Have you ever seen a reindeer fly? - Yes.

              - Well, I haven't. - Have you ever seen a million dollars?

              No!

              Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

              Hey, Neal. Howdy, sport.

              - Hi, Dad. - You wanna take a walk? I wanna talk to you.

              - Sure. I'll get my coat. - Okay. Hustle up.

              Scott? Can I have a minute?

              Sure.

              I think Charlie is conflicted at the moment.

              Wow. Really?

              Boy. Hmm. Appreciate your analysis. I really do.

              But, boy, you got more important things to worry about, you know.

              Like, where are you gonna get more sweaters after the circus pulls outta town?

              Scott! I mean, you're not listening.

              We are very concerned about this.

              Concerned about what?

              This--

              If Charlie spending time with you is the best thing for him.

              You were right about the sweater, okay?

              Do you think by next year I'll be big enough to drive the sleigh all by myself?

              - No! - But I've been practising.

              No, that's not what I'm talkin' about. Charlie, hold on a second.

              We've got to talk about this Santa Claus thing.

              Charlie, there-- there is no--

              No what, Dad?

              There's no reason why we have to tell anybody about the North Pole.

              - Why not? - Well, sometimes some things, big things,

              should remain un-- unsaid, like between two people--

              - Oh, you mean like a secret. - Yes. Like a secret. Let's keep it a secret.

              How come?

              Because of Mom and Neal.

              Not just because of them. There's school.

              Everybody thinks-- Well, it's not important what they think.

              It--

              How does five bucks sound to ya?

              This is something I really want you to do for me, sport.

              I want to keep this secret. Will ya do that, please?

              - Okay, Dad. - All right.

              Great.

              You don't have to worry about the Santa Claus thing any more.

              So when do I get the five bucks?

              ...   in the morning. It's gonna be a beautiful day.

              Spend the day with me, Larry B.

              Huh?

              Something's wrong with the mirror.

              What? Something's wrong with the scale.

              Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh--

              Hmm. I'll have a field green salad and-- Oh, my God.

              - What the-- - What? Scott?

              Calvin?

              Sorry, um, the dry cleaner in my neighbourhood went up in smoke.

              Some big chemical fire. All my clothes, poof, gone.

              God. Your-- Your weight.

              What happened?

              Bee sting. Evidently I'm allergic.

              Almost killed me. But the guy at the emergency room says...

              the swelling will go down.

              I hope. So, did I miss anything?

              No, we were, uh, just about to order lunch.

              Great! I'm starving.

              I'll have a salad and iced tea and dressing on the side.

              Uh, pasta and tomatoes, uh, and very light on the oil. Can you do that?

              And I'll have a Caesar. No dressing.

              And one of those home-made cookies, the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.

              And, uh, a little slice of cheesecake. Uh, creme brulee...

              and, um, hot fudge sundae, extra hot fudge.

              On the side.

              - Anything to drink? - Ice-cold milk.

              - Stung by a bee, Scott? - A big bee.

              Finished?

              Okay, now, remember. This is just a storyboard.

              But here is our preliminary...

              Total Tank TV spot.

              Okay, now, we've got Santa. He's up in the North Pole.

              He's gettin' ready for... Christmas!

              - Oh, no. - Problem?

              It's just a little thing. The elves.

              - What about the elves? - They look so funny.

              They're supposed to look funny. They're elves.

              Just my opinion. Can't they look a little younger...

              with silver specks on their cheeks?

              - Can we continue here? - Okay.

              Now, this year Santa's not goin' out in a sleigh.

              This time he's goin' Total Tank.

              Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's goin' anywhere without his sleigh.

              He would if he's tryin' to sell the Total Tank.

              Well, isn't that a pretty picture.

              Santa's rollin' down the block in a panzer.

              Well, kids, l-- I certainly hope you've been good this year.

              'Cause it looks like Santa just took out the Pearson home.

              - Incoming! - Oh, please.

              And another thing. What about the reindeer?

              Reindeer and Santa. Santa and reindeer. I-lt's kind of a package deal.

              - Calvin. - You don't believe in Santa, do ya?

              Calvin, can we get back to the presentation?

              I'm not done yet. Since we've opened this box,

              have any of you tried to build the Total Tank?

              It's got       parts, and even if you do get it together, it breaks ten minutes later.

              - Then you gotta spend more money just to buy new parts. - I thought that was the whole point.

              No, no, no, no.

              What we gotta do is develop a, a basic, simple, inexpensive toy...

              that will nurture a child's creative thinking.

              - Calvin-- - Here, try the brown ones.

              Can I see you outside a minute?

              I don't know what's happening to you.

              You're starting to look like the Pillsbury dough boy.

              - Y-You're falling apart. - I know! I know.

              -I don't know what came over me. -W-Well, just get some help.

              You know, y-you should s-see a doctor, a shrink, a dietician, anything.

              Just get some help.

              Okay, Scott. Time is up.

              - Let's get over here and check your pulse. - All right.

              Okay, hmm?

              Huh? Well, nuts. I--

              Oh, no, uh, your pulse is great. I--

              Well, l-l don't know, Scott. Y-You're as healthy as a horse.

              Yeah, Clydesdale.

              Okay, look. So, what? You put on a little weight.

              A little weight? Does this look like a little weight to you?

              Well, weight can fluctuate from year to year.

              Fluctuate? You make it sound like I'm retainin' water.

              I've gained    pounds in a week. Pete, what's happenin' to me?

              - Well, what's your diet like? - Milk and cookies.

              - Really? - But I don't finish all the milk.

              Well, then, there is your problem. Just try to cut back on the sweets, okay?

              - Anything else? - Yeah.

              How fast does hair grow? Facial hair?

              -What? -I shave in the morning and in the afternoon I look like this.

              Well, it could be a hormonal imbalance.

              - That would explain the mood swings. - Mood swings?

              - Yeah, well, look at my hair. It's turnin' grey. - Oh, it's middle age, buddy.

              It happens. And with that body, you should be thankful you have hair.

              Look, i-if it bothers you, you can dye it, and you should diet!

              Ah, just kidding. Okay, up with the shirt.

              Let's take a listen to the old ticker. Whoa. Okay.

              Ooh, it's cold.

              Over here, Steve! I'm open!

              What?

              I want some ballet slippers.

              - Hi, Mom. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

              - Hold on now. - Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.

              Fax me. Hi. Hey, this probably looks pretty odd, doesn't it?

              - These kids lined up all by themselves. - Scott,

              I think it's safe to say you're taking this Santa thing to an unhealthy level.

              Here's my card. Call me.

              Scott, l-- I really have to tell you that this is beginning to scare me.

              I never in my wildest-- Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest--

              But certainly never in my normal dreams would l--

              - But then this is Scott we're talking about and l-- - Laura, the point.

              It's just I never thought you would stoop to changing your physical appearance...

              in order to make Charlie like you.

              - Do you have any concept of how dangerous this is to a little boy? - Whoa.

              - Whoa, whoa. "How dangerous"? - Mom, what's the matter?

              - Come on, Charlie, we're going home. - But we just started.

              Well, a-- You let him stay. I'll go.

              If you don't get your act together, Scott, so help me--

              - Watch it, folks. - I will just-- Oh! - Mom! - Come on. Move it, lady!

              Kick it!

              - Hi there. - Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.

              - You S.C.? - Scott Calvin, that's me.

              Sign here, please.

              -All right. -Thanks. I'll get your packages.

              - Packages? - Yeah, there's quite a few of them.

              Great. I'll leave the door open. Just leave them inside here.

              Will do.

              It's the list.

              "Armand Assante"?

              Yo!

              Hold it! Hold-- Oh! Hold it!

              - You! You! Take that! Come on! Come on! - Stay away from the truck.

              What am I supposed to do with all these packages, guys? Come on.

              Aah.

              You know, I knew it. I knew that-- that something was going on. I just-- I--

              What I can't believe is that he would go behind our backs all this time,

              confusing Charlie again just--

              I-- I-- What are we-- What are we supposed to do?

              Well, there's one obvious alternative.

              Okay.

              Aah.

              - Annie, nice. - Beep!

              - Johnny, naughty. - Johnny, wait up.

              Gary, nice.

              Veronica, very nice.

              In your dreams, sleigh boy.

              Huh?

              I'm in big trouble. Mm-hmm.

              Thank you.

              Judge Wayland's office.

              Charlie, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute?

              It's okay, honey. Come on.

              We won't be long.

              Are we doing the right thing, Neal?

              -Something needs to shake Scott. -Yeah, but--

              But to-- to take away his visitation rights.

              Honey, the man is delusional.

              Okay, okay, so maybe I'm having second thoughts, kind of. I just--

              I mean, what was so bad about Charlie believing in Santa?

              Well, he's a little old.

              Oh, come on, Laura. Don't you remember when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?

              I was Charlie's age, I guess, l--

              I wrote Santa a letter every week that year.

              Well, you know, okay, you know, maybe--

              Maybe not every week, but--

              Boy, I really wanted a "Mystery Date" game.

              Do you remember those?

              No. Of course you don't.

              You know, no one does.

              I-- I don't even think they make them any more, but--

              Well, anyway--

              Christmas morning came and--

              Oh, I got dozens of presents.

              Oh, I got everything.

              Except "Mystery Date."

              I was three, and it was an Oscar Meyer wienie whistle.

              Christmas came. No wienie whistle.

              And that's when I stopped believing.

              You were three?

              Yeah.

              Oh, Neal.

              -Where's Charlie? I want to talk to him. -He's with the judge.

              Dad!

              It's all okay. I told the judge everything...

              about you and the North Pole.

              After reviewing all of your testimonies,

              I've come to a very difficult decision.

              I'm sorry to do this in light of the holiday season,

              but in the best interest of the child,

              I'm granting the petition of Dr and Mrs Miller.

              Mr Calvin, as of today,

              all of your visitation rights are suspended...

              pending a hearing after the first of the year.

              - Hey, Neal. - Scott.

              - You're not supposed to be here. - Don't make me beat you up, Neal.

              Oh, would Santa really beat someone up?

              - I'm this close. - So you still believe you're Santa?

              - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know?

              Of course you are, Dad. How can you say that?

              -Think of all those kids. -The only kid I'm thinkin' about is you.

              Dad, I'm fine. You can't let them down.

              - They all believe in you! - Charlie, listen.

              You listen! You think you know who he is. You don't!

              Charlie. Honey, listen. You're confused.

              I know exactly who he is.

              Charlie, he's not Santa!

              He is too, Santa! We went to the North Pole together.

              I saw it. The elves are real old even though they look like me.

              Bernard called me sport, 'cause he knew everything.

               Right, Dad?

                Remember!

                Thank you, Charlie. Thank you.

                I love you, Dad.

                Could you guys leave us alone for a minute?

                I mean, so I can say goodbye to him properly?

                You saw! You saw the ball come to life.

                You bet I did.

                -Well, Charlie, I guess l-- I better go. -I'll get my stuff.

                Well, wait, sport. Sport. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

                I think it's a much better idea if you just stayed here with your mom.

                I wanna be with you, Dad.

                Boy, I love hearing you say that.

                You mean I can go?

                Boy, this bird is dry. Haven't you people heard about basting?

                Bernard!

                - Hiya, sport. - Bernard, can I go? Please, can I go, Bernard?

                It's okay with me.

                Charlie, if, uh--

                Charlie?

                Scott!

                Charlie!

                This is our perpetrator.

                Scott Calvin,    years old.

                Believes himself to be Santa Claus.

                Ladies and gentlemen, this one's not gonna be easy to find.

                Uh, won't the bright red suit and beard give him away?

                Charlie's got some great ideas on how to keep you safe.

                Santa, this is Quintin, head of research and development.

                - Quintin, good to meet ya. - Hello, Santa.

                Charlie and I have put our heads together, and I think we've got a few surprises for you.

                This is some of the best stuff that's come out of the workshop since the ball.

                Fabulous. What happens if I fall off the roof?

                Is this the most current photo you have?

                Hold on.

                - Hello? - Mom. - Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.

                Honey, how are you? Are you-- Are-- Where are you? Are you okay?

                I'm fine. We're up at the North Pole.

                Charlie, are you sure you're okay?

                I'm terrific! I'm helping the elves build a new sleigh.

                We're trying for a vertical takeoff. Well, gotta go. The elves need me.

                - No, Charlie, wait. No, don't hang up the phone, honey. - Don't worry, Mom. Everything's fine.

                - See you at Christmas. - Charlie, don't-- Ah.

                Fireplaces will no longer be a problem.

                It's a new fabric. Completely flame retardant.

                - It's light, yet durable. - And you can wear the jumpsuit under your coat and pants.

                But what do I do if I fall off a roof?

                We'll cordon off a three-block radius around Dr Miller's house.

                Now, Calvin is to be apprehended unharmed.

                And remember, he'll probably be dressed like Santa Claus.

                Give it your best shot

                'Cause what you got is oh, so sweet

                - Freeze! - What the--

                I need a routine So gimme all your lovin'

                - It's not even my suit. It's a rental. - All your hugs and kisses too

                "From Comet, To Santa." Did you make the card?

                It's a nice rope. Just in case I fall off the roof?

                Comet, this means a lot to me. Thanks, buddy.

                And if I blow my top

                Will you let it go to your head

                Gimme all your lovin' All your hugs and kisses too

                All right, let's go!

                - You ready to go, sport? - You betcha, Dad. - Gimme all your lovin'

                - Now Dasher, now Dancer! Now Prancer and Vixen! - All your hugs and kisses too

                On Comet, on Cupid! On Donner and Blitzen!

                Bye-bye. Bye, Quintin. Bye, Peewee.

                Merry Christmas.

                Take your time.

                Turn to your right. Hello!

                No.

                - Charlie, stay in your seat. - I gotta show you this.

                Radar-jamming jingle bells, snow screen,

                DC-   alert and air freshener.

                - Wow. - And most important of all, your hat.

                - My hat? - It's lined with a two-way radio.

                Microphone's in here. It connects you directly to Judy.

                - Wait a minute. What's this? - Oh, that's a C.D.

                - Compact disc. - No. Cookie/cocoa dispenser.

                The cocoa comes out nice and hot.

                - And... out pops the cookie. - Gimme all your lovin'

                - How could I have done this without you, Charlie? - You couldn't.

                - You're fatter this year. - Thank you very much. You've grown too.

                And you were a very good girl this year, but I want you to go back to sleep, okay?

                - I think the milk's a little sour. - It's soy milk.

                - Huh? - You said you were lactose intolerant.

                I did say that, didn't l? Thanks for remembering.

                Go to sleep.

                - Merry Christmas, Sara. - Merry Christmas, Santa.

                Look, there's Mom and Neal's street! Can we go there next?

                - Sure. - I made something for them at the workshop.

                Freeze!

                Ah, ho, ho.

                You officers really gave me a start. Merry Christmas, guys.

                - Not for you, fat boy. - "Fat boy"? Guys.

                - Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now. - Oh!

                Guys, guys, I got a lot of work to do. This is a big mistake, really.

                You gotta watch the suit too. This is so old. It's an antique, you know.

                - Where's the boy? - He's in the sleigh.

                We got Calvin. We're bringing him out.

                Santa, are you okay? Over. Over.

                - Watch your head. - Santa, are you all right? - Santa?

                - It'll be okay, kids. - Let him go! Let Santa go!

                Honey, I'm sure Charlie's fine.

                We've got a problem. Santa was at the Miller's, but he's not responding.

                Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.

                - Let's go! - Go!

                Go, go, go, go! Move it!

                Look, I know you're Scott Calvin.

                You know you're Scott Calvin. So let's make this simple.

                I say, name. You say, Scott Calvin.

                Name?

                Kriss Kringle.

                - Name? - Sinter Klas.

                - Name? - Pere Noel.

                Buono Natale. Pelz-Nicole.

                Topo Gigio.

                Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours in the tank will change your mind.

                - Charlie? - Yeah?

                Don't worry. We're the good guys.

                Come on. Let's go save Santa.

                We can't. The police are watching this place.

                Yeah, they probably are. But you see, we weren't figuring on walking out the front door.

                We find that we can get around a lot faster if we fly.

                Now... grab hold of my hand.

                And hang on tight.

                - And Charlie? - Yeah?

                Don't ever try this without elf supervision.

                Hmm? Ah!

                We're looking for Santa Claus.

                Go home, kids. Visiting hours are over.

                We're not kids, and we're not visiting.

                - We're here to bust out my dad. - You're the Calvin boy.

                Who-- Who are these other kids?

                We're your worst nightmare.

                Elves with attitude.

                Shouldn't have had that doughnut. Oh!

                Untie me! I mean it!

                Untie--

                - Charlie! - Are you okay, Dad?

                I am now.

                - How'd you do that? - Tinsel. Not just for decoration.

                Hmm.

                Hey, excuse me. Can I get some of that tinsel?

                Mom?

                Mom!

                Neal. I'm home!

                Charlie?

                - Charlie? - Charlie. - Oh, my God, Charlie.

                Sweetheart. Oh, God. Come here. Come here.

                Oh, my boy. Oh, my sweetheart.

                Oh! My boy, you're home!

                Oh, I missed you so much. How are you?

                - I'm fine, Mom. - Are you okay? Look at me.

                - Oh, Charlie. I missed you, honey. - Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.

                - We were so worried about you. Look at you. - Mom, put me down. Stop kissing me!

                I don't have a lot of time.

                Did you leave the gifts I made under the tree?

                - You bet I did. - We better go.

                - No, Charlie. No, no, no. - No! No, wait, Charlie.

                It's okay, Laura.

                Actually, l--

                I think it's a much better idea...

                - that you stay here with your Mom and Neal. - Really?

                - But, Dad-- - No buts, Charlie.

                I can't be selfish. I can't be with you all the time.

                We're a family.

                You, me, your mom...

                and Neal.

                And they need to be with you too.

                I miss you too much.

                Come here a minute.

                Ah, listen to me.

                Come on, listen. There's-- There's a lot of kids out there.

                Okay? Millions of kids.

                And they're-- They all-- They all believe in me. They're countin' on me, Charlie. And l--

                I'm not gonna let them down. I got a lot of work to do.

                So I can't be selfish either.

                You gave me a wonderful gift, Charlie. Listen, a wonderful gift.

                You believed in me when nobody else did.

                You helped make me Santa.

                Selfish? Come on.

                You're the least-- the least selfish person I know.

                I love you, Santa Claus.

                I love you, son.

                Shh.

                It's okay.

                Okay. It's okay. Shh.

                Laura, what do you think? Christmas Eve you guys spend with Charlie?

                Oh, my God.

                It's you.

                It really is you.

                You really are...

                Santa Claus.

                Pretty cool, huh?

                Oh, my God.

                And your parents thought I'd never amount to anything.

                Oh, wait. Don't go yet. I have something for you. I--

                It's Santa!

                - Scott. - Neal.

                - Santa? - It's okay, Neal.

                Here.

                It's, um-- Well, it's--

                It's my Christmas present for you. It's the, um-- It's the custody papers.

                And I want you to come and see Charlie as often as you can.

                You can count on it. Thanks, Laura.

                Merry Christmas.

                What's all this boo-hooing goin' on here? Hey, how ya doin'?

                It's nothin', Bernard. I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.

                What goodbye? Charlie, you still got the glass ball, right?

                - Yeah. - Well, all you gotta do...

                is shake it whenever you want to see your dad.

                - Really? - He can come back to see you...

                anytime day or night.

                Hey, have I ever steered ya wrong?

                Nice sweater.

                Hey, did we make this?

                Laura.

                He's sucking us into his delusions.

                Look at the elaborate measures he's taken.

                Neal, relax.

                I'll explain it to you later.

                Where'd he go?

                Go, go, go, go! Team one, heads up!

                - Okay, stand back, folks. Give us some room. - I'm scared, Dad.

                - Here you go, sir. - Thanks. Return to your homes!

                - Stay off the street. Come on, folks. Let us do our job here. - Oh, my gosh. Um--

                Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

                Um, you know, you don't have to send anybody-- Oh, my gosh, wait!

                - Hey! - He's my ex-husband, and he's already up the chimney.

                Chief, look up there.

                Oh, Santa!

                Santa Claus.

                Look!

                What is it?

                Oh, wow!

                Up there! Do you see it? Hey, do you see it?

                - Goodbye, Charlie. - Bye, Dad.

                Merry Christmas to all! And to all a good night!

                - I'm sorry, Charlie. - That's okay, Neal.

                You were just denying your inner child.

                You're gonna make a great psychiatrist one day, kid.

                No, I think I'm going to go into the family business.

                Look out below!

                My wienie whistle.

                Bye, Santa Claus. Bye.

                - Merry Christmas. - See you next year.

                Charlie? Time to come inside.

                Mom, this stupid ball's not working.

                Shoot.

                - Hey, sport. - Dad!

                You miss me already? I've been gone, what? Ten minutes.

                Gimme a break. I was on my way to Cleveland.

                Come here and give me a hug.

                Oh!

                - Do you wanna go for a quick ride? - Yeah!

                -Uh-- -Of course, it's up to your mom.

                Please, Mom.

                Go on. Get outta here.

                All right. Hold on.

                - On our way. - Bye, Mom.

                Just-- Just a quick one.

                And, uh, not over any oceans, Scott.

                - Bye, Mom! - Scott.

                - Bye. - Scott!

                Santa!



The Santa Clause 2 

  

  

 

                   

- I'm gettin' somethin' on the sonar!

- What is it?



 

                   

Strong reading from

underneath the cap rock, sir!



 

                   

- Possible oil flow?

- Still analysing.



 

                   

It's, uh...



 

                   

Sounds like, uh...



 

                   

Tiny hammers.



 

                   

Let's go skating!



 

                   

- They're coming right at us!

- Take us to Elfcon three!



 

                   

Take us to Elfcon three.



  

                   

These guys aren't stopping.



  

                   

- Take us to Elfcon two!

- Let's go to Elfcon two.



  

                   

We have a partridge

in a pear tree.



  

                   

You take us to Elfcon one.

Let's rig for silent running.



  

                   

- Look alive, everybody!

- OK, we're at Elfcon one.



  

                   

- I lost it!

- What do you mean, you lost it?



  

                   

Wait!



  

                   

What the...?



  

                   

Uh...



  

                   

Sir, you're gonna

want to hear this.



  

                   

Find out where

that music's coming from.



  

                   

Santa, I've got her

on the locator.



  

                   

- What now?

- It's just gone.



  

                   

In the middle of the chorus!



  

                   

Nobody needs to

know about this.



  

                   

Maybe we should mention the

Smokey Robinson thing, sir.



  

                   

We're at Elfcon four.

All clear.



  

                   

Curtis, what do you say we get

you headphones this Christmas?



  

                   

It's all right, everybody.

Let's get back to work.



  

                   

Curtis, you're     years old.

Grow up!



  

                   

Bernard.



  

                   

You know I didn't break

any of the rules -



  

                   

according to The Santa Handbook.



  

                   

The handbook! Curtis, do you

go pee-pee with that thing?



  

                   

It says elves are encouraged

to listen to music.



  

                   

It makes them more creative,

more productive and more alert.



  

                   

Look out!



  

                   

Aagghh!



  

                   

- It's OK.

- Let's go!



  

                   

Is he all right?



  

                   

Wow! That's gonna leave a mark.



  

                   

Oof!



  

                   

Is that Blitzen?

Looks like Prancer.



  

                   

- Who is that?

- It was Chet.



  

                   

- A reindeer in training.

- Oh.



  

                   

Hmph!



  

                   

Well, please tell me

that it's early in his training.



  

                   

Wow! Nice fall.



  

                   

Curtis, when are you

gonna tell him?



  

                   

Not now!



  

                   

It's so cold up here.

How can you not be freezing?



  

                   

You have not seen cold till you

see where my dad lives. It's...



  

                   

Don't be embarrassed.

My parents are divorced.



  

                   

- No big deal.

- I'm not embarrassed.



  

                   

- Why don't you talk about your dad?

- He doesn't like me to.



  

                   

- It's complicated.

- Is he a spy?



  

                   

No, he...



  

                   

He works with toys and these...



  

                   

Iittle people. Kids.



  

                   

Can we just do

what we came here to do?



  

                   

Sure.



  

                   

All right.



  

                   

Charlie, this is

really dangerous.



  

                   

Someone could catch us

at any moment.



  

                   

Kinda exciting.



  

                   

Well, you know, Danielle, I may

not come out of this alive.



  

                   

So, in case we don't

see each other again...



  

                   

Aagghh!



  

                   

Are you OK?



  

                   

Oof!



  

                   

- Almost done.

- OK. I'm not leaving.



  

                   

Hello, Charlie.



  

                   

Hello, Principal Newman.



  

                   

OK, try it now.



  

                   

OK, all right.

Here's what we need.



  

                   

Get one more bolt on that flange

and it's ready for Christmas.



  

                   

Good work, guys. Whew!



  

                   

Perfect job on suspension,

you guys.



  

                   

Thinkin' outside the box.

I love it.



  

                   

- Do you want a cookie, Santa?

- Do I want a cookie?



  

                   

Yes! What's fresh?



  

                   

Oooh!



  

                   

Sweet, just like you.



  

                   

Alexander, let's think.



  

                   

Take the hat off.



  

                   

Too much counterweight.



  

                   

Thanks, Santa. You're the man.



  

                   

That's why they give me the big

belly, so I don't fall over!



  

                   

Hey, Joey! How's that

static-free-tinsel coming?



  

                   

Hey, guys, Santa wants to

see the new tinsel.



  

                   

I could come up there and take

care of this the ugly way.



  

                   

Or... we go outside

and play some football.



  

                   

Curtis, you need to

tell him right now!



  

                   

I don't know.

He's so happy right now.



  

                   

And why do I have to be

the one to tell him?!



  

                   

Because I'm the head elf.

I don't give bad news.



  

                   

It's one of the perks

of my seniority.



  

                   

Now, tell him!



  

                   

Come on, pork chop. Bring it on.



  

                   

Who you callin' pork chop,

meatloaf?



   

                   

Meatloaf?!



   

                   

You wanna talk some trash?

I'll talk trash with ya.



   

                   

- But first, I'm gonna blitz.

- Ready, set!



   

                   

- I'm comin' after you, buddy.

- Seven swans a-swimming!



   

                   

Six geese a-laying!



   

                   

Five golden rings!



   

                   

Hike!



   

                   

Hey, who's got the ball?

I can see it. Let go of me.



   

                   

He's too quick! He spins!

He moves! He's on the way!



   

                   

And he might go all the...



   

                   

way!



   

                   

Rumblin', stumblin', bumblin'!



   

                   

Oh, they pile on!



   

                   

OK, you win!



   

                   

You guys aren't elves.

You're wizards!



   

                   

No matter how many times you run

that play I never see it comin'.



   

                   

Santa? We need to talk.



   

                   

- That's weird, isn't it?

- Uh-oh!



   

                   

- These fit yesterday.

- Hot cocoa for you.



   

                   

This is not a good time, Abby.



   

                   

I sent Dasher down

for some Brazilian cocoa beans.



   

                   

- What's the bad news?

- What do you mean?



   

                   

Whenever you play the designer

bean card, you have bad news.



   

                   

What are you doing with

the naughty-and-nice list?



   

                   

Don't shoot the messenger.



   

                   

- It's... Charlie.

- Sheen?



   

                   

- I thought he straightened out.

- Not that Charlie.



   

                   

My Charlie. My son Charlie?

He's on the naughty list?



   

                   

- There's gotta be a mistake.

- We don't make mistakes.



   

                   

I'm sorry, Santa.

Please excuse me.



   

                   

How could this happen? Is this

what you were trying to tell me?



   

                   

Great! You told him! Let's get

you dressed for that meeting.



   

                   

I can't have the meeting here.

I'm gonna have to see Charlie.



   

                   

- Number two, tell him now.

- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.



   

                   

- Santa, there's a clause.

- That would be me.



   

                   

No, I mean there's another

Santa clause.



   

                   

Curtis, in case you haven't

noticed - this time of year,



   

                   

the malls are filled with

other "Santa Clauses".



   

                   

Yes, but there's another

Santa clause.



   

                   

There was a first clause,

but also a second clause.



   

                   

Get on with it!



   

                   

When the last Santa fell off your roof

and you put on his coat, you found this.



   

                   

Right. "He who wears the coat



   

                   

takes on the responsibilities

of Santa Claus."



   

                   

And the rest

would be history, right?



   

                   

But it seems our number two elf,

the keeper of the handbook,



   

                   

overlooked the single

most important detail



   

                   

in the history of Christmas!



   

                   

Wow! One mistake in     years.



   

                   

Look.



   

                   

- I can't see that.

- Better now?



   

                   

- Or now?

- Well...



   

                   

- Better now?

- It's gettin' there.



   

                   

- Or now?

- I can't see anything.



   

                   

I see. Good, good, good.

I see it. OK.



   

                   

"The card holder acknowledges

a woman of his choosing..."



   

                   

"True love... Not valid

in the state of Utah..."



   

                   

"Holy...



   

                   

matrimony?!"



   

                   

- I gotta get married!

- Yes.



   

                   

It's... the Mrs clause.



   

                   

What if I don't want

to get married?



   

                   

Oh, dear. The de-Santification

process has begun!



   

                   

The de-Santification?



   

                   

Are you telling me that clause

says if I don't get married...



   

                   

I don't get to be

Santa any more?



   

                   

Wh-... what about the kids?



   

                   

What about the elves?



   

                   

- What about you guys?

- It's not completely hopeless.



   

                   

You still have time

to find a wife.



   

                   

- How much time do I have?

-    days.



   

                   

   days? So I've gotta...

find a wife by Christmas.



   

                   

Actually, Christmas Eve.



   

                   

- I guess it's over.

- No! You can't think that way!



   

                   

Please, don't give up hope.



   

                   

Cos if you do, then we have to.



   

                   

- Whoa!



   

                   

Christmas is getting

very complicated.



   

                   

Santa?



   

                   

Santa?



   

                   

- Are you with us?

- I'm sorry, yes. Yes, I am.



   

                   

Well, on behalf of Father Time and

the Council of Legendary Figures,



   

                   

I'd like to thank you for being

such a gracious host.



   

                   

- Hear, hear.

- What a lovely place.



   

                   

Without further ado, let us

convene the year-end conference.



   

                   

- Tooth Fairy.

- Thank you, Mother Nature.



   

                   

Fellow Council members,



   

                   

I'd like to again propose

a new name for myself.



   

                   

- Oh, please!

- Good heavens!



   

                   

In the past, you have rejected

Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.



   

                   

- Because they stunk.

- Today, I'd like to submit...



   

                   

- Captain Floss.

- Nice!



   

                   

- Plaque Man.



   

                   

- And Roy.

- Roy! No.



   

                   

No kid's gonna put a tooth under

a pillow for a man named Roy.



   

                   

This from someone in a diaper

who shoots people's butts!



   

                   

Wait a minute. I got it.

I got it. I got it.



   

                   

Now, how about this?

The Molarnator.



   

                   

The Molarnator! I like it.



   

                   

Thank you, Santa. Can we

vote now on the Molarnator?



   

                   

All in favour of a name change

for Tooth Fairy?



   

                   

All right. And all opposed?



   

                   

Easter Bunny?



   

                   

- Sandman?

- Wha-...?



   

                   

What happened?

Was I asleep again?



   

                   

Name change for the Tooth Fairy.

Yes or no?



   

                   

No. I'm sorry.



   

                   

All right. Next item on the

agenda. Santa? Status report.



   

                   

OK. First, welcome to the North

Pole. Great to have you here.



   

                   

This is our big time of year,

so things are busy as usual.



   

                   

There's a little speed bump

in the road this year.



   

                   

- You all know Charlie.

- I love Charlie!



   

                   

- Great kid.

- Good boy.



   

                   

- Sweet kid.

- Good teeth.



   

                   

Well, Charlie...

got himself on the naughty list.



   

                   

- What?!

- Oh, my!



   

                   

I'm struggling with the timing,

cos it's...



   

                   

I gotta be up here and I've also

got to take care of Charlie...



   

                   

That's every parent's dilemma:



   

                   

how to balance

work and children.



   

                   

Most people lose sleep over that.



   

                   

Tell me about it! I have      

offspring. All in private school.



   

                   

Well, to top it off... I have to get

married by Christmas Eve.



   

                   

- What?!

- Otherwise I stop being Santa.



   

                   

- What?!

- No!



   

                   

The de-Santification process

has already begun.



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

You do look thinner, and...



   

                   

- Your beard is shorter! Right?

- You're right!



   

                   

Apparently,

it's called the Mrs clause.



   

                   

Don't mess with me, Santa.

I'm pre-El Nino.



   

                   

No, I'm not messing with

anybody. What I'm saying is...



   

                   

I have to find a wife in...



   

                   

   days,    hours

and     minutes.



   

                   

- Wow!

- It's what I do.



   

                   

Wait a minute. Cupid!

Cupid, come over here.



   

                   

- What do you need?

- Shoot me with a dart.



   

                   

- Then I'll fall in love.

- First of all, they're arrows.



   

                   

Second of all, no can do.



   

                   

- Why not?

- Arrows have no effect on us.



   

                   

If they did, I would have shot

myself, met a nice girl,



   

                   

Ieft the business years ago.



   

                   

- Enough with the questions.

- You can't stop being Santa.



   

                   

I don't want to.



   

                   

Kids are    per cent happier

since you've taken the job.



   

                   

- He's right.

- This is all I want to do.



   

                   

But what am I gonna do?



   

                   

Well, you...



   

                   

You can't be two places at once.



   

                   

Maybe you can be.



   

                   

OK, everyone, can I get the

room for a minute? Thank you.



   

                   

Can I just...? One minute.

Take a cocoa break.



   

                   

Have a nice long break.

Relax, everyone.



   

                   

I want to show Santa some improvements

on the pantograph. Thanks.



   

                   

Walk with me. I've tripled the RAM

and reconfigured the circuitry.



   

                   

I see you've externalised

the power source



   

                   

to make better use of

the electromagnetic energy.



   

                   

No, it's just there

cos it looks really cool.



   

                   

Yeah, it does.



   

                   

Wait a minute.

You tripled the RAM.



   

                   

I see where this is going. I am

not getting in that machine.



   

                   

Besides, creating a copy of

Santa won't solve our problems.



   

                   

- The elves'll know.

- But this would be a special toy!



   

                   

- How's that, Curtis?

- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.



   

                   

The duplicate will look

and think just like you.



   

                   

When you're with your family, dealing

with Charlie, looking for a wife...



   

                   

The toy will be up here melting

in front of my fireplace.



   

                   

No, the toy Santa will be

dealing with business up here.



   

                   

I can deal with

business up here.



   

                   

Santa, if the elves find out

we've made a switch... Aaggh!



   

                   

No! No!

This machine is not the answer.



   

                   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

You! You! Shoo!



   

                   

Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!



   

                   

Look, you can't get

much better than that.



   

                   

And I promise -

it won't hurt a bit.



   

                   

- I'm goin' in.

- I can't watch this!



   

                   

Ow! Ow!



   

                   

It's perfect!



   

                   

That's because it's me,

Einstein.



   

                   

- Santa, are you all right?

- Yeah, I got a shock in there.



   

                   

Is there supposed to be a shock?



   

                   

Aagghh!



   

                   

It's naked!



   

                   

Throw something over it.



   

                   

- It's incredible!

- Yes, it is.



   

                   

Can he talk?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Ho, ho, ho!



   

                   

Ho, ho... ho!



   

                   

- Not bad.

- Not bad yourself.



   

                   

I can't put my finger on it,



   

                   

but there's something

about you that I like.



   

                   

There's something

about you that I like!



   

                   

- Watch him. I'll be right back.

- He's coming right back.



   

                   

Ha-ha-ha!



   

                   

- Bernard, I need your help.

- What do you mean?



   

                   

What I mean is

I gotta go see Charlie



   

                   

and I want you to

convince the elves...



   

                   

that... toy Santa is me.



   

                   

- Hm. Have you seen that thing?

- I've seen it.



   

                   

Keep the elves

at a distance and say



   

                   

that I've changed my look,

it'll work.



   

                   

Santa, we're in

way over our heads here.



   

                   

If anybody can do this,

it's you, number one.



   

                   

I... I'm not gonna lie to all the elves.



   

                   

I myself think he looks

absolutely terrific!



   

                   

Better and fresher somehow

than he has in years.



   

                   

There's now a more supple

veneer to his skin



   

                   

and an added lustre

to the thickness of his hair.



   

                   

You could almost say

there's a...



   

                   

a toy-like quality to him.



   

                   

Most importantly, he's very

happy with his new look,



   

                   

and I would caution you all

not to point or stare



   

                   

or use the word "plastic".



   

                   

OK? OK.



   

                   

Thank you. That's all.

Back to work, please.



   

                   

Comet, because I don't

want to take Prancer.



   

                   

I want to take a trip with you.

When's the last time we had a cruise?



   

                   

I love you, buddy.



   

                   

Besides, Prancer had too many

apples. We know what that means.



   

                   

Before you go,

take a look at your watch.



   

                   

Hey! Can't go anywhere

without that.



   

                   

- I've done some work on it.

- It's beautiful. It really is.



   

                   

- You like it?

- The workmanship's fabulous.



   

                   

It has a power reserve that measures

how much magic you have left.



   

                   

- It's at ten.

- That should be enough.



   

                   

But if you use up any magic

for any reason the level drops.



   

                   

Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't

be able to return to the Pole.



   

                   

Uh-oh.



   

                   

Then let's not let it get to zero!



   

                   

- Now, look at me.

- Mm-hm?



   

                   

What's the most important thing?



   

                   

For you not to touch Santa?



   

                   

For you to come back!



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

Comet, please just

chill out a little bit, OK?



   

                   

Come on! It's not like we're

pullin' the sleigh. Right?



   

                   

There's no packages.

It's one stop.



   

                   

And I think I might have forgot

we're gonna go see Charlie.



   

                   

Scott! Hey!

You trimmed your beard.



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

Come here, big guy.



   

                   

Whoa! Lost some

weight there, huh?



   

                   

- Slim-Fast?

- You don't know how fast.



   

                   

- We should get going.

- Oh, OK.



   

                   

How do you always know

when there's a problem?



   

                   

I see you when you're sleepin'.

I know when you're awake.



   

                   

Which is a pretty frightening

concept when you think about it.



   

                   

We're really worried

about Charlie.



   

                   

He keeps upping the ante. This

time he defaced school property.



   

                   

- It's classic acting out.

- I'm blaming myself for this.



   

                   

- We're both his parents.

- Where is he?



   

                   

He's waiting for us

in Principal Newman's office.



   

                   

Something about her makes me

want to deface public property.



   

                   

Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.



   

                   

- Miss Newman.

- Principal Newman.



   

                   

Haven't seen you since the last

time Charlie was in trouble.



   

                   

I've been travelling for work.



   

                   

If you spent more time with your

son there'd be fewer problems.



   

                   

Then I wouldn't spend

so much time with you,



   

                   

which is always

such a pleasure.



   

                   

A battle of wits. It's a shame

you come unarmed. Excuse me.



   

                   

Ouch!



   

                   

Good morning, Principal Newman.



   

                   

Mr Picardo, I want you to look into

my eyes. What do you see?



   

                   

It's dark. And it's cold.



   

                   

It's your future, Mr Picardo -

keep this up



   

                   

and you will spend

your life stabbing trash.



   

                   

- Do I make myself clear?

- Yes.



   

                   

- So what are you gonna do?

- I'm going to geometry.



   

                   

Have a nice trip.



   

                   

It's an affront to authority and

blatant disrespect for property.



   

                   

If this continues I'll have no

other recourse than to suspend..



   

                   

Excuse me. Is there a rest stop between

here and the end of the lecture?



   

                   

I'm more interested in why this

happened in the first place.



   

                   

So am l. Charlie, we're all

worried about you.



   

                   

It feels like you're trying to

get someone's attention.



   

                   

What's bothering you?



   

                   

- Dr Miller?

- Neil.



   

                   

- Neil, any theories?

- Well, frankly I have several.



   

                   

Here we go.

Let's just order a pizza.



   

                   

Scott, you're not helping.



   

                   

I was listening to a tape series

on child development last night.



   

                   

You know what the problem is?

Excuse me, Neil.



   

                   

It's four weeks until Christmas.



   

                   

- That's a holiday in December.

- Oh.



   

                   

Have you noticed the hallways?

Not a decoration, not a twinkle light,



   

                   

not an expression of the joy

kids are supposed to be feeling.



   

                   

- What kind of school is this?

- A public school.



   

                   

A top-rated public school.

That takes effort. And money.



   

                   

Spending any of that money

on holiday decorations



   

                   

would take away from

the things that truly matter.



   

                   

Forgive me, but I think

holiday cheer really matters.



   

                   

What are we going to do?

We are worried...



   

                   

Let me handle this. You know

what you did is wrong. Right?



   

                   

- I guess so.

- There's no guessing.



   

                   

Guessing is gone.

It was wrong what you did.



   

                   

And you're not gonna

do it again. Promise me.



   

                   

- OK.

- There you go.



   

                   

He won't do it again.

Meeting is adjourned.



   

                   

It most certainly is not!

Charlie...



   

                   

You know what else?

Here's a little donation.



   

                   

Why don't you

buy yourself a wreath?



   

                   

I am Santa Claus.



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

Yeah. No, no,

I think that this is gonna work.



   

                   

Good... Good job, Curtis.



   

                   

Would it kill you to give

a wholehearted compliment?



   

                   

Ho, ho, ho.



   

                   

- Ho, ho, ho.

- Santa?



   

                   

- I need you to look at this.

- All right!



   

                   

Nice!



   

                   

No. I mean,

I need you to read it.



   

                   

Well, let's try to be

specific, shall we?



   

                   

Ha-ha!



   

                   

I'll take a look at it

over at my desk.



   

                   

- How does he know where it is?

- I programmed him that way.



   

                   

He has most of Santa's memories.



   

                   

OK, we need you to study

everything that's in that book



   

                   

because it is the key

to being Santa.



   

                   

Right! I'll memorise

everything in the book.



   

                   

I'll follow all the rules.



   

                   

Cos rules are very important!



   

                   

- I like this guy.

- I can barely read this.



   

                   

Hi, Santa.



   

                   

Uh...



   

                   

- Hi.

- Oh. You look...



   

                   

Like he got

a good night's sleep.



   

                   

Like you got a very

good night's sleep.



   

                   

How about a nice

chocolatey cocoa?



   

                   

- Careful, it's hot.

- Of course it is.



   

                   

Aagh!



   

                   

Whoo!



   

                   

That's delicious! I like cocoa!



   

                   

Cocoa's superior refreshment!



   

                   

Get me some more cocoa!



   

                   

Whoo!



   

                   

Right away, Santa.



   

                   

Ho, whoa!



   

                   

I think Santa feels

a little buzz!



   

                   

Whoooo!



   

                   

Let me get this straight.

You were de-Santified?



   

                   

And you only have    days

to find a wife or you're out?



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

What are you gonna do?

We dated for three years



   

                   

before you got up

the courage to propose.



   

                   

That's a pretty serious

commitment issue, isn't it?



   

                   

Yes, Sigmund. I was afraid

I'd mess up the first time.



   

                   

- I'm more afraid now.

- Dad, you can't give up.



   

                   

There's never been

a better Santa.



   

                   

I appreciate that.



   

                   

It's for the best. If l

had spent more time with you,



   

                   

you'd spend less time in

the spray paint industry.



   

                   

Don't do that to yourself.

You have been a great dad.



   

                   

And being Santa has made you

an even better man.



   

                   

I'm gonna go out

on an emotional limb.



   

                   

Don't try to make me cry.



   

                   

Believe it or not, you have

a great capacity for love.



   

                   

I know you can

find someone wonderful



   

                   

to spend the rest of

your life with.



   

                   

Don't let the facts that you

have no time, no prospects



   

                   

and a paralysing fear of

intimacy get you down.



   

                   

Hm.



   

                   

Have you ever

helped anyone? Ever?



   

                   

You know what I'm gonna do? I am

gonna look through my phone book



   

                   

and see who's still single out

there and not too bitter.



   

                   

There's divorced moms at school

who'll go out with anybody.



   

                   

As promising as this sounds,

I don't need help with this area.



   

                   

Your old man was a high-school

legend. A double letterman.



   

                   

I had a Mustang.



   

                   

So as far as dating goes,



   

                   

I think if anybody can stir up

the old mojo it would be moi.



   

                   

Come on! I don't think

there's a woman out there



   

                   

that doesn't want

a piece of this.



   

                   

- Hi, Mom!

- Lucy!



   

                   

- Uncle Scott!

- How's my little sweet pea?



   

                   

Ohh! I haven't seen you in a long time.



   

                   

- Tell me what's been happenin'.

- I learned to swim underwater.



   

                   

- And I'm not afraid!

- That's amazing!



   

                   

Maybe we'll have to go to the mall

and... get some ice cream.



   

                   

- Plenty of women at the mall.

- Charlie...!



   

                   

Santa, look forward and

put on a smiley face.



   

                   

- Say hello to your elves.

- Ho, ho, ho!



   

                   

You're doing a wonderful job!



   

                   

Santa, when you said the bigger

wheels, is this what you meant?



   

                   

Ho, ho, ho!



   

                   

You're doing a wonderful job!



   

                   

You're doing great.

Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,



   

                   

but otherwise you're gold.



   

                   

Ho, ho ho!



   

                   

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!



   

                   

Why don't you just say it? "You

were right, Curtis. I was wrong."



   

                   

OK, OK, I admit it.



   

                   

They're happy.

They're working hard.



   

                   

Everything's going to be fine.



   

                   

This book is very

interesting reading.



   

                   

There's a lot of rules

they're not following.



   

                   

That's what I've been

saying all along.



   

                   

Things have gotten

a little too sloppy around here.



   

                   

Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.

Mistakes aren't a good thing!



   

                   

I might have to

make some changes here.



   

                   

- What do you have in mind?

- Let me show you.



   

                   

There's many things.

Look here...



   

                   

Neil, are you sure you don't have

any other clothes I can borrow?



   

                   

I mean, the idea tonight

is to attract a woman.



   

                   

- What are you talking about?

- I look like a limesicle.



   

                   

I think it makes you look hot.



   

                   

What do you think, Laura?

Honestly, what do you think?



   

                   

Doesn't he look hot, Laura?



   

                   

I think it's what's inside

that really counts.



   

                   

- Thought you liked the sweater.

- We'll talk later.



   

                   

I'm off.

I may need to borrow a car.



   

                   

I'm parked behind Neil. The

minivan - I just had it washed.



   

                   

The minivan.



   

                   

OK, then. Well, wish me luck.



   

                   

I got a needlepoint sweater,

and a minivan...



   

                   

See ya in about eight minutes.



   

                   

Scott? Hey.



   

                   

- Tracy!

- Yes!



   

                   

- It's nice to meet you.

- Nice to meet you.



   

                   

- Here, why don't you sit down?

- Oh, thank you.



   

                   

Thank you very much.



   

                   

So, I'm so glad

we finally got to do this.



   

                   

- I'm pretty nervous.

- Oh, are you?



   

                   

Laura says

we have a lot in common.



   

                   

I hear that you love

this time of year also?



   

                   

It's my favourite time of year

and my busiest time of year.



   

                   

- Whoa, look at the sweater!

- Yeah!



   

                   

Some sweater.

Like I should talk!



   

                   

I also have my Christmas

charm bracelet.



   

                   

- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!

- Yeah.



   

                   

I wear it all year long

just to keep the spirit alive.



   

                   

That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear

and packages. That's very nice.



   

                   

- So what work do you do?

- I'm in the toy business.



   

                   

- No way!

- Way!



   

                   

- That sounds so creative.

- I love it.



   

                   

- I love creative people.

- Yeah?



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

So what do you do?



   

                   

I'm hoping someday to break

into the music business.



   

                   

- As a singer-songwriter.

- No way!



   

                   

Way!



   

                   

- What's your favourite music?

- Country-western.



   

                   

- Ohh!

- Yeah.



   

                   

- Do you like Shania Twain?

- Yeah!



   

                   

- You know that one?

- I know that song.



   

                   

- You're good.



   

                   

- Hey!



   

                   

- That's good.



   

                   

Put up a tree!

Sports on TV!



   

                   

Man!



   

                   

Whew!



   

                   

You hated it?



   

                   

It kind of scared me

a little bit.



   

                   

No, I just. I...



   

                   

I just... I wasn't prepared

for a performance, so if l...



   

                   

I put myself out and that was

not an easy thing to do.



   

                   

If you can't support

a woman's ambition,



   

                   

then I don't think there's any

reason to continue this date.



   

                   

- Dad?

- Hey, sport.



   

                   

How'd it go?



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

Let's just say

I'm not bookin' a church yet.



   

                   

Boy, I'll tell ya,

women are hard to figure out.



   

                   

- Tell me about it.

- You too, huh? Girl trouble?



   

                   

Well, there's this one girl.



   

                   

We just used to be friends and

hang out at the mall and stuff.



   

                   

Then one day I looked at her



   

                   

and I got this weird feeling

in the pit of my stomach.



   

                   

I started worrying about

what to wear



   

                   

and what my hair

looked like...



   

                   

And then I wanted to kiss her.



   

                   

How did she do that?



   

                   

I don't know.

But they all can do that.



   

                   

Oh, look at that.

The snow globe!



   

                   

This is so beautiful. I remember

when Bernard gave this to you.



   

                   

He said all I have to do

to see you is shake it.



   

                   

Uh-huh.



   

                   

Now, all you have to do

is yell down the hall.



   

                   

And I'm there

whenever you need me.



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

I'm a little tired, Dad.

I'll see you in the morning.



   

                   

OK.



   

                   

- Good night.

- Night.



   

                   

Can you turn

the light off, please?



   

                   

Yeah, cos it's

such a big reach for you!



   

                   

What do you mean

it's not straight?



   

                   

- Sure it's straight.

- Uh-uh.



   

                   

- Maybe your head's crooked.



   

                   

- Prancer's not this picky.

- Yes, he is.



   

                   

- Hi, Comet.

- Hi!



   

                   

I've got something for you.



   

                   

Hey, Lucy,

what have you got there?



   

                   

Careful with the sweets.

He tends to overeat.



   

                   

Uncle Scott,

are you Santa Claus?



   

                   

What? Why would you ask me

something like that?



   

                   

Cos you have a reindeer,

and only Santa has reindeer.



   

                   

Nonsense.

A lot of people have reindeer.



   

                   

Name five.



   

                   

Well... most of them

live in Finland.



   

                   

I can't pronounce their names.



   

                   

Besides, reindeer are too stupid

to make good pets.



   

                   

Well, I think you're very smart.



   

                   

Well, I think he's learning

at an excellent rate.



   

                   

Oh, really? This morning

he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

I need the

naughty-and-nice list.



   

                   

No.



   

                   

It says I'm supposed to

check it twice.



   

                   

- Santa already checked it.

- No, I didn't.



   

                   

- The real Santa.

- I am the real Santa!



   

                   

- I'm sorry?

- I'm in charge here.



   

                   

- What?

- I check the list twice.



   

                   

That's the rule.

I like the rules.



   

                   

- You know how I feel.

- You're misunderstanding.



   

                   

No, I'm the rule-maker. I like

the rules. Santa likes rules.



   

                   

I've got a good idea.

How about we have some fun?



   

                   

Huh?



   

                   

- It's good to have fun.

- Right.



   

                   

Santa, look over there.

See those elves?



   

                   

Go ahead.

Go play some tinsel football.



   

                   

Break!



   

                   

- What's the object of tinsel football?

- Come on down.



   

                   

If you don't have the ball,

get it.



   

                   

If you have the ball,

run to the end zone.



   

                   

OK, I'll go get the football.



   

                   

Ready, hike!



   

                   

I've got the ball. What are you

gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?



   

                   

Come on!



   

                   

This is a lot of fun!



   

                   

Oh, so sorry!



   

                   

Come here! Stop! Slow down

when I'm talking to you!



   

                   

Come here, you! Come on.



   

                   

He's headed east

toward the main entrance!



   

                   

Hello, Charlie.



   

                   

Hello, Principal Newman.



   

                   

Are Laura and Neil

on their way?



   

                   

No, I volunteered to go solo.



   

                   

Oh. You look...



   

                   

You've lost weight.

Feeling all right?



   

                   

I was until I got

this phone call.



   

                   

Charlie, you promised you

weren't gonna do this again.



   

                   

What's the matter with you?

I'm gonna have to punish ya.



   

                   

I'll ground him for...

two months.



   

                   

- I thought you were on my side!

- I'll go one better.



   

                   

- You're suspended.

- But... Dad!



   

                   

I'm as upset about

this as you, but isn't there



   

                   

a punishment that doesn't mean

takin' him out of school?



   

                   

- What did you have in mind?

- We could...



   

                   

Uh... ah...



   

                   

Community service?



   

                   

Huh.



   

                   

That's not a bad idea.



   

                   

OK, Charlie. I want you to

start by cleaning up this wall.



   

                   

I want everything

off of there by tonight.



   

                   

And then clean off every mark

off every locker in this hallway.



   

                   

- Every one?!

- Do as she says, Charlie.



   

                   

But I have homework,

tests to study for.



   

                   

Not my problem. I have a

detention group on Saturday.



   

                   

So we will all get together

at the rec centre



   

                   

and scrape off graffiti at  am.



   

                   

- See you both there.

- You say both of us?



   

                   

No, l... I'm very busy. I do a

lot of other community service.



   

                   

That's good. You just got

yourself elected parent rep.



   

                   

And, Charlie...

We'll talk about the suspension.



   

                   

Curtis, what is he doing

in the naughty-and-nice centre?



   

                   

- What's going on?

- I'm checking the naughty-nice list.



   

                   

- I'm checking it twice.

- I already told you!



   

                   

It's been checked. Don't worry.



   

                   

I do worry.

There's a lot of mistakes.



   

                   

I'll give you

a big fat for instance!



   

                   

In Denmark, there's a guy

named Sven Halstrom right here.



   

                   

He's a Dane. He was wiping

his nose on his sister's shirt.



   

                   

Yuk! That's not very nice!

And yet he's on the nice list.



   

                   

We try to cut most children

slack this time of year.



   

                   

I don't understand that!

Kids are misbehaving everywhere.



   

                   

They're running with scissors.

They're sticky.



   

                   

"I'm not gonna stop this car!"

"No, we're not there yet!"



   

                   

"Brush your teeth!"

"Pick up those clothes!"



   

                   

It goes on and on.



   

                   

But they're just kids!

Everybody misbehaves some time.



   

                   

But according to

The Santa Handbook,



   

                   

naughty kids get lumps of coal

in their stockings. Right?



   

                   

We will make stockings.



   

                   

In my opinion, they should all

get coal in their stockings.



   

                   

- Don't you?

- No! That's not how it works!



   

                   

Get me the naughty-nice list.

Get me every list!



   

                   

Get me everything.



   

                   

Mr O'Reilly, Mr Leary.



   

                   

You in charge of the gangbangers?



   

                   

They're students,

actually, and yes.



   

                   

Keep 'em away from the car.

It's new.



   

                   

I don't need some delinquent

kids scratchin' it up.



   

                   

They're not delinquents.

And don't worry about your car.



   

                   

I'd worry about your legs

in those shorts.



   

                   

I thought only swimmers

shaved their legs!



   

                   

Whoa, good one!



   

                   

- Good morning.

- Good morning.



   

                   

- Brought you coffee.

- Thank you.



   

                   

- So you have a nice-guy side.

- I'm a man of many sides.



   

                   

I'm a puzzle.

I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.



   

                   

- A laugh! Actual laugh.



   

                   

- Dad, it doesn't come off.

- It's not supposed to come off.



   

                   

Hence you've got to be

careful where you put it.



   

                   

Hence tagging is serious.

Hence your presence here.



   

                   

Don't say "hence" any more, Dad.

It's really annoying.



   

                   

Nicely done!



   

                   

How do you do it? I have trouble

with one. You have hundreds.



   

                   

- Hi.

- Hi.



   

                   

- I was really good this year.



   

                   

Is that so? Are you absolutely

sure about that, Pamela?



   

                   

I want a doll house

and a swimming pool.



   

                   

A swimming pool?



   

                   

I'm sorry. She insisted

on talking to you.



   

                   

- It's not a problem.

- OK.



   

                   

I'll tell you what. If you can

promise me you'll be good,



   

                   

I can guarantee

you'll have a great Christmas.



   

                   

- OK! Yeah!

- Come on.



   

                   

Kids get so nutty

this time of year.



   

                   

- Is she a neighbour?

- No.



   

                   

Oh. How did you know her name?



   

                   

Oh, the... necklace,

it said Pamela on it.



   

                   

Oh, I guess I missed that. I'm

gonna go check on this group.



   

                   

You cost me, Pamela.



   

                   

I just couldn't sleep

thinking about all those rules.



   

                   

Am I wrong? Am I right?

Does it matter?



   

                   

Couldn't have been the three

gallons of cocoa I had!



   

                   

But you understand rules, don't

you? You're highly decorated.



   

                   

And look at that face.

There you go.



   

                   

There's a face

only a mom would like.



   

                   

I don't have a mom,

so I wouldn't know about that.



   

                   

Now, it's time

for the big event.



   

                   

Guess what?



   

                   

Son, it's show time!



   

                   

You're in the spotlight.

Get bigger with it.



   

                   

It's your big chance.

I need a little help.



   

                   

I need a little muscle.

I need a little nudge.



   

                   

Let's call yourself

the little nudge!



   

                   

This won't hurt - except for the

electric shock through you.



   

                   

See ya on the other side!



   

                   

- Oh. Hi.

- Hi. Uh...



   

                   

It looks like you're going out.



   

                   

- Sorry. I should have called.

- No, it's OK. Come in.



   

                   

- You sure?

- Uh-huh.



   

                   

- Is there a problem?

- No, no. I just...



   

                   

I wondered if, um...



   

                   

If you would...



   

                   

Do you want to go

get some noodles?



   

                   

Or pie?



   

                   

But I don't want to

keep you from your date, so...



   

                   

Oh, it's not a date. It's the

faculty Christmas party.



   

                   

Is that your idea of

a night on the town?



   

                   

Noodles and pie?



   

                   

- Yes. What would be your idea?

- Pizza and a movie.



   

                   

- Thick or thin crust?

- Thin.



   

                   

Good! Movie?



   

                   

Two For The Road.

Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.



   

                   

Movie's OK, but the car

was the star. '   MGTD.



   

                   

Racing green, wire wheels...

Beautiful.



   

                   

I'm impressed. That is

a great car. My favourite car.



   

                   

Didn't like driving 'em

in the rain.



   

                   

You have to push it to start it.

Other than that it's perfect.



   

                   

It's perfect, though.



   

                   

- I could drive you to your party.

- That would be great.



   

                   

Except for, eventually,

I'm going to have to get home.



   

                   

Well, l... I could pick you up.



   

                   

So you're going to drop me off,

then come back and pick me up?



   

                   

- Yeah.

- Why don't you just stay?



   

                   

- All right, I'll stay.

- I'll get my coat.



   

                   

So, Mr Andretti,

what are you driving?



   

                   

You know...

I think you're gonna like it.



   

                   

Mind if I ask you

something personal?



   

                   

Please.



   

                   

- You look really different.

- The weight.



   

                   

It's lndian teas and it's a lot

of salves and stuff. It's...



   

                   

- Do you want some cocoa?

- Uh, yes.



   

                   

Cocoa.

You have thought of everything.



   

                   

Well, this time of year,

l... I really shine.



   

                   

Yeah, I can't wait

till it's over, though.



   

                   

Streets are crowded,

the malls are jammed,



   

                   

people max out their credit cards...

It's noisy.



   

                   

When did you become

such a cynic?



   

                   

Oh. I don't know.



   

                   

I used to love Christmas, too.



   

                   

It was the only day

that my parents didn't fight.



   

                   

- Oh.

- Oh.



   

                   

They were at each other

all the time.



   

                   

But on Christmas, they tried

to make the holiday special.



   

                   

My dad went through this charade

so I'd believe in Santa Claus.



   

                   

He put a cot by the fireplace

so Santa could take a nap...



   

                   

Like he has time to take a nap!



   

                   

Consider the amount of gifts

he would have to... deliver.



   

                   

Why would he nap? He

would probably need some coffee.



   

                   

Yeah. And there was

cocoa and cookies.



   

                   

And carrots for the reindeer.



   

                   

That's a good gesture.

The reindeer love carrots.



   

                   

And the thought is

important to them, too.



   

                   

Yeah. And I'd wake up and the cocoa

and cookies would be gone



   

                   

and the cot would be mussed

and the carrots gnawed.



   

                   

They swallow them. If they're

fresh they'll eat 'em like that.



   

                   

They love red bell peppers, too.



   

                   

You know the stories.

If you read...



   

                   

And there would be incredible

presents under the tree.



   

                   

One year was a rocking horse,

and I named it Harvey.



   

                   

And the next year was

a little red wagon,



   

                   

which I made a lemonade stand,

which was great.



   

                   

And the last year was...



   

                   

It was just... a Baby Doll. She was

pink and soft and beautiful.



   

                   

- Beautiful?

- Yes.



   

                   

I believed in Santa so much

I'd get in fights at school



   

                   

with kids who tried to tell me

that he didn't exist.



   

                   

And one day

I came home with a bloody nose.



   

                   

That's when my parents

decided to tell me to...



   

                   

grow up.



   

                   

I was devastated, and...



   

                   

Good, Carol! This is great

sleigh-riding conversation!



   

                   

- I'm a terrible sleigh con-..

- It's fine conversation.



   

                   

A person just wants something

to believe in, you know?



   

                   

Yes, I know. Yes, I know.



   

                   

OK, we have cocoa.



   

                   

We have a blanket.

We have a horse-drawn sleigh.



   

                   

The only thing that's...



   

                   

- What?



   

                   

- It's snowing.

- Oh.



   

                   

As if by magic?



   

                   

That's what I was gonna say,

that it should be snowing!



   

                   

I owe you one.



   

                   

It's a great party.



   

                   

Look. That guy moved.



   

                   

- Would you excuse me?

- Mm-hm.



   

                   

Could I have your attention?

Your attention, please!



   

                   

There we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin and

I just thought I'd step up here and...



   

                   

and say the word that we've all

been longing to hear.



   

                   

Fire!



   

                   

OK. What I think, folks, is

that a lot of you have forgotten



   

                   

what the true spirit

of Christmas is all about.



   

                   

Mm?



   

                   

If you're not willing

to dance or laugh or flirt



   

                   

or risk the buffet, I don't

think we have much choice.



   

                   

So before the choir gets out

here I say we rock this house



   

                   

with a secret Santa! Huh?



   

                   

Carol - happy, happy Christmas!



   

                   

I think they're just

decorations for the carollers.



   

                   

She's afraid these are

decorations for the carolling.



   

                   

I think Carol is right

about the carolling!



   

                   

I'm talking about the packages

that are backstage.



   

                   

There aren't any

packages backstage.



   

                   

Ohh! There's none back there.



   

                   

So I was mistaken

when I saw this bag of gifts.



   

                   

Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure

looks like a bag of gifts.



   

                   

Ohh! It's heavy

like a bag of gifts.



   

                   

Look at this! What's in here?



   

                   

It's very heavy, very heavy.

Doesn't your mom call you JJ?



   

                   

Merry Christmas, JJ.



   

                   

No way.



   

                   

This is Toss Across!



   

                   

I used to love this

when I was a kid!



   

                   

But I never told anybody.



   

                   

Where did...? Who did this?



   

                   

Grace Kim.



   

                   

Yes, there you are!

Merry Christmas.



   

                   

- Thank you.

- Tom Astle.



   

                   

- Me! Sorry, Gordon.

- Hey!



   

                   

- Haven't changed a bit!

- Gee, thanks.



   

                   

- Lizzy Garcia.

- Here.



   

                   

- There. Merry Christmas.

- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!



   

                   

Mint condition!

This is incredible!



   

                   

The Holly Hobbie Oven!



   

                   

Come on up and get

the rest of your presents.



   

                   

- Marie?

- Here!



   

                   

There she is. Katie. Jerry.



   

                   

- Here!

- Cory. Cory?



   

                   

Here!



   

                   

- Carl, you need a net.

- Not me!



   

                   

This is great.



   

                   

Hey, party animal,

you want to play?



   

                   

- I can't figure it out.

- It's beanbag tic-tac-toe.



   

                   

No, I mean

the secret Santa thing.



   

                   

Someone tracked down all those

wonderful antique toys.



   

                   

Probably someone who knows

his way around eBay.



   

                   

- Yeah.

- Yep.



   

                   

It was you. I know it was you.



   

                   

I just can't figure out...

How did you do it?



   

                   

Sometimes you don't need

to know all the answers.



   

                   

Speaking of which...



   

                   

Even the principal

needs a Christmas gift.



   

                   

Merry Christmas.



   

                   

Come on, open it. Rip it open.



   

                   

Come on.

We're not gonna save the paper.



   

                   

It's Baby Doll.



   

                   

Come here.



   

                   

- Did you call the office?

- No.



   

                   

- Did they call you?

- It's not like that.



   

                   

- Did you investigate us?

- No, I wouldn't do that.



   

                   

Did you...? I told you about

Baby Doll an hour ago, and...



   

                   

Did you send someone to...?



   

                   

- No.

- No.



   

                   

Well... I don't know

how you did it.



   

                   

It's like some kind of magic.



   

                   

Yeah, sort of like

some kind of magic.



   

                   

And... and pretty much

the last that I have.



   

                   

What? Well, what...?

You know what?



   

                   

I don't want to know.



   

                   

What you did in there tonight

for everyone was wonderful.



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

I'm sorry.



   

                   

I shouldn't have done that.



   

                   

- Is that OK?

- Yeah.



   

                   

Got this weird feeling

in the pit of my stomach.



   

                   

I'm, um...



   

                   

I'm not...

real good at this.



   

                   

Where did that come from?



   

                   

I don't know.



   

                   

Hi! Merry Christmas!



   

                   

Ho, ho, ho!



   

                   

Can I have your attention?



   

                   

Stop the work, please.

Everybody stop the work.



   

                   

- Merry Christmas!



   

                   

That's nice. I have a little

announcement to make.



   

                   

From this moment forward, we're

not gonna make any more toys.



   

                   

The children of the world

don't deserve presents.



   

                   

They're running rampant

with naughtiness.



   

                   

This Christmas we're gonna

give those greedy kids



   

                   

exactly what they deserve.



   

                   

A beautiful, high-quality

yet low-sulphur variety of coal!



   

                   

Quiet!



   

                   

We have to focus,

all of us, on the goals ahead.



   

                   

And just to make sure

that that happens...



   

                   

Thank you, sweetie.



   

                   

I... I hate to blow my own horn.



   

                   

Stay where you are!

Don't be afraid!



   

                   

Back! Back!



   

                   

I was up late, couldn't sleep.



   

                   

Milk wouldn't do it,

cocoa is a little sweet,



   

                   

so I decided to make

an army of toy soldiers.



   

                   

They don't have

a good sense of humour like me.



   

                   

I would do what they ask you.

Which is what I'm going to tell you!



   

                   

Don't listen to him!

This guy's not Santa!



   

                   

- He's not Santa?

- He's a toy!



   

                   

He has a rubber face

and a plastic tushy!



   

                   

Trust me!

Don't let him ruin Christmas!



   

                   

Thank you for

those kind words, Bernard!



   

                   

Well, now that we all

have an understanding,



   

                   

have a joyous and

merry Christmas!



   

                   

Merry Christmas!



   

                   

OK, ready? Go!



   

                   

This is what I call

community service!



   

                   

Here she comes. Duck down!



   

                   

Hey!



   

                   

Attention you hooligans

behind that snow bank!



   

                   

You have snowballed

the wrong house.



   

                   

Drop the snowballs, kick them

away from the snow suits



   

                   

and keep the mittens

where I can see them.



   

                   

Your dad is hanging with

Principal Newman?



   

                   

- Is he dating her?

- No.



   

                   

Go to your homes.

Uh... pelt the ones you love.



   

                   

- And a merry Christmas!



   

                   

- That is really gross, man.

- Shut up.



   

                   

There are things about me you

should know. Personal things.



   

                   

We don't need to

rush things, Scott.



   

                   

I think you need to

know these things.



   

                   

OK.



   

                   

Um...



   

                   

Remember the mistletoe,

how it just showed up?



   

                   

- Yes.

- And the sleigh.



   

                   

- How magical that was?

- Yes.



   

                   

Secret Santa Claus?



   

                   

- That was me.

- Yeah?



   

                   

I'm not this size much. I'm

usually much bigger than this.



   

                   

So am I sometimes.



   

                   

I have a big white beard

that's beautiful.



   

                   

- I don't.

- I work a long way from home.



   

                   

When I get back home,

I sleep for a long time.



   

                   

See? OK.

It's not so bad so far.



   

                   

You work far away from home

and you sleep a lot.



   

                   

You've never been to prison

and you don't wear socks with sandals.



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

I'm Santa Claus.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

The suit, the red suit's real.

The North Pole is a place.



   

                   

There are elves. They make toys.

They're beautiful and it's real.



   

                   

- I exist.

- That's not funny.



   

                   

- It's magical.

- Cut it out.



   

                   

I'm telling the truth.



   

                   

I told you something personal

from my childhood



   

                   

and now you're making a joke

out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.



   

                   

I know how hard this is to

believe, but connect the dots.



   

                   

- Think what's happened.

- I know what's going on.



   

                   

- Think about the little girl.

- You felt something for me.



   

                   

Now you're acting like a mental

patient because you're scared.



   

                   

- I deliver gifts in a sleigh.

- lncredible.



   

                   

I go down chimneys with burning

logs and I still deliver gifts.



   

                   

I'm not scared.

That's not what this is.



   

                   

If you're trying to

push me away, it's working.



   

                   

Carol, don't make me leave.



   

                   

Please.



    

                   

- How could you pick her?

- I didn't.



    

                   

You don't care any more.



    

                   

I care more about you

than anybody.



    

                   

But it's a two-way street.



    

                   

- You won't confide in me.

- You want it? Here it is.



    

                   

- What? Talk to me.

- I don't live a normal life.



    

                   

- You live a great life here.

- Just listen to me!



    

                   

My friends get to go around

saying, "My dad's a plumber."



    

                   

"My dad's a pilot." "My dad's

a dentist." You know what?



    

                   

My dad is the best thing of all

and I can't tell anyone.



    

                   

You have no idea how hard it is,

walking around with that secret.



    

                   

And now you're going out

with Principal Newman!



    

                   

And you don't even

tell me about it.



    

                   

My whole life has become

about secrets, and I hate it!



    

                   

I'm sorry.



    

                   

Forget about

Principal Newman, all right?



    

                   

And forget about Santa.

I'm done.



    

                   

My time's up.



    

                   

Who cares any more?



    

                   

- Hi, Charlie.

- Hi, Lucy.



    

                   

- What are you doing?

- Just shovelling.



    

                   

Oh.



    

                   

Charlie, is Uncle Scott

Santa Claus?



    

                   

No.

Why would you think that?



    

                   

I don't know.



    

                   

- How come Uncle Scott was sad?

- What makes you think that?



    

                   

I asked him to stick

a straw in his nose



    

                   

and blow bubbles

in his milk.



    

                   

- And he said no.

- Whatever.



    

                   

- Can you talk to him?

- I don't think so, Lucy.



    

                   

- Did you have a fight?

- Sort of.



    

                   

- Are you gonna make up?

- I don't know!



    

                   

- Are you gonna be mad forever?

- Lucy!



    

                   

- What?

- These are hard questions.



    

                   

No, they're not. They're easy.



    

                   

And you can't be mad

at him forever, Charlie.



    

                   

He's your daddy

and you love him.



    

                   

¡Ó Dashing through the snow



    

                   

¡Ó In a strip-mining machine



    

                   

¡Ó Flatten the hills we go



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Put a smile on that face,

little troll!



    

                   

Wait a minute. I got a joke.

This'll cheer you up.



    

                   

- Knock, knock!

- Who's there?



    

                   

- Aren't you?

- Aren't you who?



    

                   

Aren't you supposed to

get back to work?!



    

                   

All of ya! You little idiots!

Back to work!



    

                   

Got any twos?



    

                   

Hm.



    

                   

Go fish.



    

                   

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!



    

                   

Whooaahh!



    

                   

- What was that?

- I don't know.



    

                   

- Want some more hot chocolate?

- Mm-hm.



    

                   

OK.



    

                   

- Would you get that, honey?

- Yeah, sure.



    

                   

Is S... Scott here?



    

                   

- Who are you?

- Uh...



    

                   

Curtis, a friend from...

Buffalo.



    

                   

- Are you an elf?

- Of course not!



    

                   

Why would you ask

such a silly question?



    

                   

How come you have pointy ears?



    

                   

It's... because I never

ate my green vegetables.



    

                   

Do you eat

your green vegetables?



    

                   

Uncle Scott!



    

                   

Yeah, I'm right here.

What's wrong?



    

                   

Oh... Curtis! What are you doin' here?



    

                   

There's a little

trouble at the...



    

                   

plant.



    

                   

It's OK.

Curtis is a very old friend.



    

                   

We have a large, uh... firm.

We work together in...



    

                   

- Buffalo.

- Buffalo?



    

                   

We work together in Buffalo.

So... we're gonna talk business.



    

                   

- What business?

- It's none of your business.



    

                   

Soon I'm gonna be seven.

And then I can know things.



    

                   

- Good night, Curtis.

- Good night, Lucy.



    

                   

Good night, Lucy.



    

                   

- What's up?

- Toy Santa's out of control.



    

                   

He's locked up the elves,

shut down the workshop,



    

                   

he thinks everybody's naughty

and he's gonna give everyone coal!



    

                   

- Why didn't Bernard tell me?

- He's under house arrest.



    

                   

Bernard?!



    

                   

Fly back with me to the North

Pole to save Christmas!



    

                   

I can't. I have no magic left.

I'm out of magic. Look.



    

                   

Grrrr!



    

                   

- I thought you had Comet.

- Yeah, we...



    

                   

Yes! Come on!



    

                   

Hey, Comet. We just...



    

                   

Comet?



    

                   

Comet?



    

                   

Look at me.



    

                   

- Comet...!



    

                   

What are ya doin'?



    

                   

- Eating sugar is bad for you.



    

                   

What do you mean,

you didn't eat this?



    

                   

Who did?



    

                   

A squirrel?!



    

                   

Get this. You gotta fly both

of us back to the North Pole.



    

                   

- Yeah, tonight.



    

                   

OK. I'll help you up.



    

                   

All right? Ready? You've got to

help me a little here.



    

                   

Pull.



    

                   

Ai! Gah!



    

                   

Good. OK, we almost got it.



    

                   

That's OK.



    

                   

OK, now, help me.

Can ya move anything?



    

                   

Fire in the hole! Get away!



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Eat some roughage, will you?



    

                   

- Oh, what about the jet pack?

- It burned up on reentry.



    

                   

What am I supposed to do?

Grow wings?



    

                   

I hope he doesn't have

too many stops to make tonight.



    

                   

You and me both, pal.

OK. Let's just get it over with.



    

                   

OK.



    

                   

One, two...



    

                   

Three!



    

                   

- What's going on down there?

- Are you sure about this?



    

                   

What? The old toaster trick?



    

                   

When we were kids we used to do

this to get a little extra cash.



    

                   

- Works every time!

- I can't watch this.



    

                   

- You ready, buddy?

- All right. Let her rip.



    

                   

One,



    

                   

two,



    

                   

three!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Oh, Scott!



    

                   

- Scott, are you all right?

- Mom!



    

                   

- Yes?

- I lost another tooth.



    

                   

Should I put it

under my pillow?



    

                   

Yes!



    

                   

By cuspids!



    

                   

Shhh.



    

                   

This way. Come on.



    

                   

Curtis, get the door.

It's a Tooth Fairy ambush.



    

                   

What do you people want?

I only carry $   in change.



    

                   

Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.



    

                   

I've lost the weight

and the beard, but it's me.



    

                   

I know Santa. Santa is a friend.

And you, sir, are no Santa.



    

                   

I am too.



    

                   

How did I know I could capture

you by holdin' on to a wing?



    

                   

You wanted to change your name

to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.



    

                   

Or, as I recall, Roy.



    

                   

And it was Santa's idea

to call you the Molarnator.



    

                   

- Who's the kid?

- One of my elves. He's an elf.



    

                   

Ow.



    

                   

Santa!



    

                   

The Molarnator at your service!



    

                   

- A little altitude, please!

- What?



    

                   

Could you possibly

fly a little higher?



    

                   

Oof!



    

                   

- What?

- Never mind!



    

                   

Principal Newman?



    

                   

What is it, Charlie?



    

                   

You keep asking me if there's

something bothering me.



    

                   

Well, there is. I...



    

                   

I couldn't talk

about it before, but...



    

                   

I want to talk about it now.



    

                   

OK. Go ahead.



    

                   

- My dad is Santa.

- Oh, please. Not you too.



    

                   

Hold on.



    

                   

If you have no feelings

for my dad, then fine.



    

                   

But if the only reason

for not being with him is



    

                   

that you don't believe in him,

you're making a big mistake.



    

                   

Oh, Charlie...



    

                   

Here.



    

                   

I want you to take this.

Look into this and...



    

                   

try to remember what it was like

when you were little



    

                   

and you still

believed in Christmas.



    

                   

Seeing isn't believing.

Believing is seeing.



    

                   

You haven't seen anything yet!



    

                   

- Curtis?

- What? Ow!



    

                   

- What do I do?

- Slow down.



    

                   

OK.



    

                   

Piece of cake. Attaboy.

There you go.



    

                   

Why can't you fly higher?



    

                   

Tooth Fairy, I want to thank

you. I'll never forget this.



    

                   

I wish I could do more,

but I gotta go.



    

                   

Denver just started

a new pee-wee hockey league.



    

                   

Before you go,

I want you to know that nobody,



    

                   

nobody was

braver than you were today.



    

                   

You should be

proud of your wings.



    

                   

- They're not too girly?

- Not on you.



    

                   

Wouldn't it be easier

to go through the workshop?



    

                   

No. That way Santa and his

soldiers would be expecting us.



    

                   

Sound military strategy involves

taking your enemy by surprise.



    

                   

It's good strategy.



    

                   

Sometimes being a despot

is a tough business.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

It's Scott, isn't it?



    

                   

Yeah. What are you

supposed to be?



    

                   

A better, stronger version

of what you used to be -



    

                   

with a flawless complexion,

I might add.



    

                   

- Look, it just glistens.

- Listen to me. I'm back now.



    

                   

So untie us. Let the elves go

and give me back the coat.



    

                   

No can do! It's Christmas Eve!

I have coal to deliver!



    

                   

And I don't want those

naughty kids to suffer!



    

                   

Boys! One, two, three!



    

                   

And... one, two!



    

                   

Try to keep up!

Let's go. Move it on!



    

                   

Try to...

This is just too tight.



    

                   

This is all my fault.



    

                   

I thought I could

create another Santa.



    

                   

My elfin pride

blinded me to all reason.



    

                   

There's only one Santa.



    

                   

Well, I've done

a pretty rotten job.



    

                   

I didn't check the list twice.



    

                   

My kid thinks I betrayed him.



    

                   

I hurt the woman I love.



    

                   

I ruined Christmas.



    

                   

Charlie!



    

                   

How'd you get up here?



    

                   

Scott!



    

                   

I got to fly in

with the Tooth Fairy.



    

                   

- Are you OK?

- Yeah.



    

                   

Brush between meals

and don't forget the floss.



    

                   

And if anybody cares,

I'm exhausted.



    

                   

And she...

has a beautiful smile.



    

                   

- Thank you for everything.

- No. Thank you.



    

                   

I am... the Molarnator!



    

                   

Whoo!



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Hyah!



    

                   

Get out of the way!



    

                   

What are you doing?



    

                   

- You gotta save Christmas.

- How am supposed to save...?



    

                   

- No, no, no.

- Please. Don't worry.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Slow down.



    

                   

Stay.



    

                   

Whoah!



    

                   

Oh, Chet...



    

                   

Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!



    

                   

Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.



    

                   

OK. Chet, this is it.

You ready to rock and roll?



    

                   

- Chet?

- Yeah. He's still in training.



    

                   

- Has he had much flight time?

- About a minute and a half.



    

                   

- He's had a lot of crash time!

- Curtis...!



    

                   

- He's just a baby.

- All right.



    

                   

Let's see what this baby can do.



    

                   

- Oh, boy.



    

                   

Ready to go, buddy?

You know what we gotta do.



    

                   

Hyah!



    

                   

Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Chet, Chet.



    

                   

You gotta focus, Chet.



    

                   

OK, everybody! Outside, now!



    

                   

Almost there, boys. Let's go!



    

                   

- Chet, whoa!



    

                   

Snowballs, on three!



    

                   

One!



    

                   

Two!



    

                   

Three!



    

                   

OK, elves...



    

                   

Let's get 'em!



    

                   

Whoa, whoa! Not so far!



    

                   

- Whoa, Chet!

- Whooh!



    

                   

Back for more action,

eh, scooter?



    

                   

- Chet, Chet!



    

                   

Cut the chitchat, Chet!



    

                   

Why is this such a problem?

Come on!



    

                   

Where do you think you're going?



    

                   

- Go, go!

- Hyah, boy! Come on!



    

                   

Faster!



    

                   

The lead.

The one in the front, Chet!



    

                   

Leave my reindeer alone!



    

                   

- Go! Go! Go!



    

                   

Come on! We got to get them

before they get out the hole.



    

                   

Stay away from my lead reindeer!



    

                   

- Whoo!



    

                   

Holy Hannah,

he's an action hero!



    

                   

Hyah!



    

                   

What are you doin' up there?

I can't see where I'm driving.



    

                   

You are a sad,

strange little man.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

You're gonna fall... I hope!



    

                   

That's a good way

to lose an eye!



    

                   

Look out! You're scaring me!



    

                   

Can I help you?



    

                   

Honey, I'm home!



    

                   

Loser!



    

                   

Hey, I'm supposed to wear this

coat! How about a little elbow?



    

                   

There you are.

That's gotta feel good.



    

                   

You want the shoe?

Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!



    

                   

Uh?



    

                   

What are we gonna do now,

smartypants?



    

                   

Watch out!

The building! Left, left!



    

                   

Oh, well.

The town'll break the fall.



    

                   

Look out!



    

                   

Yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!



    

                   

Oof!



    

                   

Get off of me! Now remember,

rules are very, very important!



    

                   

I want hot chocolate.



    

                   

Hey, guys, back up. I've

got a special place for him.



    

                   

You idiot! Wait a minute,

something's shocking me.



    

                   

- You were great.

- Sounds like you were too.



    

                   

- We've got ten minutes.

- Where is Carol?



    

                   

- Carol! Are you all right?

- Yes!



    

                   

- Where are you going?

- I gotta deliver gifts.



    

                   

Aren't you forgetting something?



    

                   

- No.

- You gotta get married.



    

                   

Excuse me?



    

                   

Carol, l...



    

                   

I cannot continue being Santa...

unless I find a Mrs Claus.



    

                   

Oh. So that's what the whole

noodles and pie thing...



    

                   

- You just needed a wife.

- No.



    

                   

No?



    

                   

- Yes.

- Yes?



    

                   

Yes, I was looking for a wife.



    

                   

No, I didn't figure on

falling... in love.



    

                   

You love me?



    

                   

- This is all happening so fast.

- Well, there's no pressure.



    

                   

Good.



    

                   

I mean, if I don't get married

I just won't deliver the gifts



    

                   

and children everywhere

will stop believing,



    

                   

the elves will lose their jobs,

the North Pole will disappear



    

                   

and Christmas will be gone.



    

                   

- Get down on one knee.

- Hm?



    

                   

Do it. Now.



    

                   

Say "Carol."



    

                   

- Carol.

- Uh-huh?



    

                   

Yeah?



    

                   

You say this is happening

all so fast.



    

                   

You say this is happening

all so fast.



    

                   

But you've known me

your whole life.



    

                   

But you've known me

your whole life.



    

                   

When you were

little and alone...



    

                   

- Santa...

- I can take it from here.



    

                   

..Santa was always

there for you.



    

                   

And I will be, as long as you

continue to believe in me.



    

                   

I know I'm asking you

to leave everything at home,



    

                   

but I can guarantee you

that this is worth it.



    

                   

This place...



    

                   

This place is all about magic



    

                   

and love... and wonder.



    

                   

And occasionally

a thin-crust pizza



    

                   

and a movie and

a long winter night.



    

                   

Is there a school here?



    

                   

Yeah, we have one, a school, but

the elves need a new principal.



    

                   

Cos as of late some of the elves

have been acting a bit impish.



    

                   

Carol...



    

                   

- I love you.

- You do?



    

                   

Would you be my wife?



    

                   

I will.



    

                   

Thank you.

I've got it from here.



    

                   

I will.



    

                   

By the powers vested in me

by me,



    

                   

I now pronounce you Santa



    

                   

and Mrs Claus.



    

                   

Well, go on now. Kiss her!



    

                   

Awwww!



    

                   

- Dad, we gotta go.

- Walk me to my sleigh.



    

                   

We gotta go! When we get back,

we start making some more toys.



    

                   

All right. Well, Mrs Claus,

you might want to get some rest.



    

                   

You see, tomorrow begins

vacation season for me,



    

                   

which means a three-month

honeymoon for us.



    

                   

Nothing tropical. You do not

want to see this in a Speedo.



    

                   

Don't be home too late.



    

                   

And so it begins.



    

                   

Boys, we've got

some toys to deliver!



    

                   

Hyah!



    

                   

Lucy?



    

                   

What, Charlie?



    

                   

Come downstairs.

I want you to see something.



    

                   

Lucy.



    

                   

Watch this.



    

                   

Uncle Scott?!



    

                   

- Do you have any twos?

- Go fish!



    

                   

You are Santa!

I knew it was you all along.



    

                   

- And you were right.

- Uncle Scott...



    

                   

You look all rosy.

Are you feeling better?



    

                   

I'm feeling much, much better.



    

                   

Is there anything else

I should know about?



    

                   

I don't know. But Charlie has

something he wants to tell you.



    

                   

OK.



    

                   

You know, I was exactly your age

when I found out my dad was Santa.



    

                   

- But I couldn't tell anybody.

- I can't tell anybody either?



    

                   

No. But knowing it

isn't a burden.



    

                   

It's a gift.



    

                   

Most kids stop believing in

Santa when they grow up.



    

                   

But I get to

believe in him forever.



    

                   

I love you, Charlie. Thank you.



    

                   

But do we still get toys?



    

                   

If you ever get to bed and go to

sleep like the other kids.



    

                   

Oh... OK!



    

                   

- Merry Christmas, Lucy.

- Merry Christmas, Santa.



    

                   

Sport, I gotta fly.



    

                   

- Easy, boys, easy.



    

                   

You're gettin' it, Chet.



    

                   

Look, Charlie!



    

                   

Merry Christmas, Comet!



    

                   

All right, boys!

Hyah! Ho, ho, ho!



    

                   

- Hyah!



    

                   

Merry Christmas to all!

And to all a good night!



    

                   

Nothin' wrong with

a straight line, Chet.



    

                   

Chet! Chet!



    

                   

Hey!



    

                   

What the heck

are we doin' out here?



    

                   

Agh!



    

                   

Look, if we're gonna dance...



    

                   

dance like this.

All of us!



    

                   

Everybody, you idiots!



    

                   

Hey, lady!



    

                   

Watch this!



    

                   

Ever seen a toy do this?



    

                   

Where you going?



    

                   

Whoo!

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

Have a holly, jolly Christmas

But have a cup of cheer

Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be also good
If you'll check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa honey one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex and checks
Sign your 'x' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry, tonight

"Last Christmas"

Happy Christmas

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas

This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year

I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

It was December 24th on Hollis ave in the dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my god, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone
But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of g's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and all the dough was for me
It's Christmas time in Hollis queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink egg nog
The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of darryl's
But each and every year we bust chrsitmas carrols
Rhymes so loud and prod you hear it
It's christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack frost chillin, the ?orchas out?
And that's what christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer
My name's d.m.c. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear

It's 12.30 AM, Christmas Eve
I'm out with the gangstas and thieves
Celebratin', postin' up with eggnog [head up up] in my cup
[Put Rudolph and Moses] lil' bang-bangin' and coastin'
Down the block but be careful for the heart, because it's posted'
Some stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day
But, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day
Tell me, tell me, where do the homies and bums got to sleep? {Nowhere}
Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}
Life is so crucial and cold, [it's worse] for the children
In this world they hopes and dreams can't afford
The young and old churches and spiritual dreams, seasonal things
Heard throughout the ghetto reaches gangstas and dope-fiends, huh
Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it
Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood and now we ballin'
Livin' to a new year of better thangs
Celebrate it with some Champagne, ha ha, check it

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Now on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
Now on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me
A fifth of Hendog and told me to take my mind off that weed
Now by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
A whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nuthin' but game to me

Back then, you woke up to the sound of "I Saw Mama Kissing Santa"
Made you remenisce on the old fashion Christmas days
Gifts, miss a fat man jolly with joy
Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Santa Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'
Pinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain
Season's greetings, all the proceedings
Are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shout
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Santa Claus is coming straight to the ghetto

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive
So I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it
This'll be me and Mom's private secret

Die Hard

You don't like flying, do you?
What gives you that idea?
You want to know the secret
to surviving air travel?
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.
Fists with your toes?
I know. It sounds crazy.
Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.
OK.
It's OK. I'm a cop.
Trust me.
I've been doing this for 11 years.
[stewardess] On behalf
of the captain and the crew,...
..I'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.
Have a very merry Christmas.

[Japanese]
How do you do?
Ladies and gentlemen,...
Ladies and gentlemen!
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...
..for making this
one of the greatest years...
..in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.
[applause and cheering]
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,...
..and the Board of Directors,...
..we thank you one and all...
..and wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year!
[crowd] Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!
Hey, Holly.
What about dinner tonight?
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
Families, stockings,...
Chestnuts?
Rudolph and Frosty?
Any of these things ring a bell?
Actually, I was thinking more of...
..mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...
..and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?
Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?
That baby's ready to tend bar.
Last chance.
Bye.
[telephone]
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.
Mommy!
When are you coming home?
Pretty soon.
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.
Is Daddy coming home with you?
Well, we'll see what...
..Santa and Mommy can do, OK?
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.
Paulina!
Hola, Mrs Holly.
Um, did Mr McClane call?
No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.
It might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom...
..just in case.
Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.
What would I do without you, Paulina?
[woman squeals]
California!
Hey, I'm John McClane.
Argyle.
I'm your limo driver.
Nice bear.
OK... Argyle.
What do we do now?
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.
It's my first time driving a limo.
That's OK.
It's my first time riding in one.
Relax.
We got everything in this mug, man.
Look at this... CD, CB, TV,...
..telephone, full bar, VHS.
If your friend's hot to trot,...
..I know a few mama bears
we can hook up with.
Or is he married?
He's married.
OK.
Sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.
Your lady live out here?
About the past six months.
Meaning you still live in New York?
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up!?
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.
So, why didn't you come?
Well?
Why didn't you come with her?
Because I'm a New York cop.
I got a backlog of New York scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.
I can't just go that easy.
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here...
..and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.
Mind if we hear some tunes?
[rap music]
Hey, that'll work.
Don't you got any Christmas music?
This is Christmas music.
[Run DMC] # It was December 24th
on Hollis Ave. after dark #
# When I seen the man chillin'
with his dog in the park #
# I approached them very slowly
with my heart full of fear #
# Looked at his dog...
oh, my God, a ill reindeer #
# But then I was illin'
'cause the man had a beard #
# And a bag full of goodies.
# So I turned my head a second,
and the man was gone #
# But he must have dropped his wallet
smack dead on the lawn #
# I picked the wallet up,
and then I took a pause #
# Took out the licence,
and it cold said Santa Claus #
# A million dollars in it,
cold hundreds and Gs... #
So your lady sees you,
you run into each other's arms,...
..the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?
I can live with that.
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?
I'll find a place.
I tell you what...
I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,
give me a call on the car phone.
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.
- Hi.
- Good evening.
I'm here to see Holly McClane.
Just type it in there.
Cute toy.
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.
Christ.
- Thirtieth floor?
- The party.
They're the only ones
left in the building.
Take the express elevator.
Get off where you hear the noise.
Thanks.
[whistling] # Jingle Bells #
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey! Merry Christmas!
Jesus.
Fuckin' California!
[woman] I couldn't agree with you more.
Why don't I talk to him right now?
Hi. I'm looking for...
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.
Then you must be John McClane.
Joe Takagi.
How was your ride in?
Nice. I have you to thank for that?
Seemed the least we could do.
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be if we ever get it finished.
Still several floors under construction.
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.
In the meanwhile,
her office is back here.
Ellis?
[sniffing] I was just making a call.
This was the nearest phone.
I want you to meet John McClane,...
..Holly's husband.
Holly's policeman.
Ellis is in charge
of international development.
Heard a lot about you.
You missed some.
[Ellis sniffs]
Can I get you anything?
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?
No, thank you. I'm fine.
You throw quite a party.
I didn't realise they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.
We're flexible.
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.
[exaggerated laugh]
It's sort of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today...
..and a lot of it was due
to Holly. Right, Joe?
[Holly] I'll be out
in a couple of minutes.
John.
Have you met everyone?
We've been sticking him with spears.
Of course he has.
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.
I was hoping you made that flight.
Show him the watch.
Later.
Show him. Are you embarrassed?
It's just a small token of appreciation...
..for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.
I'm sure I'll see it later.
Is there a place
where I could wash up?
Sure.
You have to forgive Ellis.
He gets very depressed
this time of year.
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?
I know the type.
I think he's got his eye on you.
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast...
..I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.
Cappy Roberts retired out here.
Oh, yeah?
He said I could bunk with him.
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.
- Huh?
- Pomona.
- Pomona.
- Yeah.
You'll be in the car half the time.
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.
It's not huge or anything, but...
..the kids would love to have you
at the house.
They would, huh?
I would, too.
[woman] Ha ha! Ooh!
Sorry.
I missed you.
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?
Except maybe
when you're signing cheques?
Since when did you start using
Ms Gennero?
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...
You are a married woman.
This conversation again?
We did this in July.
We never finished this conversation.
I had an opportunity. I had to take it.
No matter what it did to our marriage.
It only changed your idea
of our marriage.
You have no clue what my idea...
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.
[knocking] Ms Gennero, I...
Excuse me.
Hi.
Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.
He wants you to say something
to the troops.
Thank you.
Speech time.
Be back in a few minutes.
That was great, John.
Good job. Very mature.
So Kareem rebounds.
Feeds Worthy on the break,
over to AC, to Magic,...
..then back to Worthy.
Boom! Two points.
We're in.

Son of a bitch.
Ha ha!
Fists with your toes.
Yeah, Argyle?
[Argyle] How's it going?
All right. Where are you?
Down at the garage.
What's with you and your lady?
The vote's not in yet.
- Hey, Bruder.
- Moment.
Nein! Nein! Nein!
Argyle?
Mac, you there? Hello?
[R&B music playing]
You know the number. Use it.

Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.
Everything's going to be fine.
Shit!
Think.
Think.
[crowd screaming]
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.
[crowd quietens]
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe...
..they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.
You will be witnesses.
Now...
..where is Mr Takagi?
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,...
..born Kyoto, 1937...
[Whispering] (Don't move)
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,...
..interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,...
..scholarship student,
University of California,...
..1955.
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.
MBA, Harvard, 1970.
President, Nakatomi Trading.
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group...
Enough.
And father...
..of five.
I am Takagi.
How do you do?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
OK, 32... construction,
[humming] # Beethoven's Ode to Joy #
Nice suit.
John Phillips, London.
I have two myself.

Arafat buys his there.
[speaking Italian]
- This way?
- On the left.

"And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain..."
"..he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer."
[chuckles]
The benefits of a classical education.
Ohh, that's beautiful.
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.
It's beautiful.
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?
Contrary to what you people may think,...
..we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.
I believe you.
I read the article in "Forbes".
Mr Takagi...
I could talk about industrialisation
and men's fashions all day...
..but I'm afraid work must intrude...
..and my associate here
has some questions for you.
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.
[beeping]
I don't have that code.
You broke in here
to access our computer?
Any information you could get...
..when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...
Sit... down!
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.
But I need the code key...
..because I am interested
in the $640 million...
..in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault...
..and the computer
controls the vault.
You want money?
What kind of terrorists are you?
Who said we were terrorists?
The bonds represent, at most...
..10 days' operating capital
for your parent organisation.
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.
Now...
..the code, please.
It's useless to you.
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.
You'll never get it open.
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.
It would be a shame to ruin it.
I'm going to count to three.
There will not be a four.
Give me the code.
One,...
..two,...
- ..three,...
- I don't know it.
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.
You're just gonna have to kill me.
OK.
We do it the hard way.
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.
[bumps head]
Nothing.
See to Heinrich.
Now...
..you can break the code?
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.
You're calling the police right now.
[loud music playing]
Of course I'm still coming by later.
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.
Uli, get up on the pipes.
Marco, you go through here.
I'll throw you the cord.
Hans, we're on the roof.
Here.
Uli.
..two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.
I'm sorry?
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?
Trust me.
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?
'Cause then you'd be dead, too,
asshole.
Think, goddamn it! Think!
[beeping]
We've got a fire alarm.
Call 911.
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.
Then disable the sys...
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?
Shall we go?
Nein.
[sirens]
Yes.
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.
Ah ha ha ha!
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!
Turn the fuckin' truck around!
[elevator bell dings]
The fire has been called off, my friend.
No-one is coming to help you.
You might as well come out
and join the others.
I promise I won't hurt you.
[whirring]
[whirring slows]
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.
You won't hurt me.
Yeah? Why not?
Because you're a policeman.
There are rules for policemen.
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.
[whirring]
Nine million terrorists in the world...
..and I got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.
I wanted this to be professional,...
..efficient, adult, cooperative.
Not a lot to ask.
Alas, your Mr Takagi
did not see it that way...
..so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.
We can go any way you want it.
You can walk out of here
or be carried out...
..but have no illusions...
we are in charge.
So... decide now, each of you...
..and please remember...
..we have left nothing to chance.
It's Tony!
Get them back!
"Now I have a machine gun."
"Ho... ho... ho."
A security guard we missed?
They're usually tired old policemen.
No, this is something else.
[Hans speaking German]
We have to do something, Hans.
Yes, we do.
Tell Karl his brother is dead.
Tell him to come down.
Karl... komm sofort.
[Hans] Franco, Fritz,
take the body upstairs...
..and out of sight.
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.
[Fritz] Komm sofort. Schnell.
I want blood!
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators...
..and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,...
..you can tear the building apart
looking for this man...
..but until then,
do not alter the plan!
And if he alters it?
[Ellis] What do you think?
Something's wrong.
Cops?
- John.
- John?
[Ellis] He can fuck
this whole thing up.
What does he think he's doing?
His job.
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.
Tell that to Takagi.
Mayday, Mayday,
anyone copying channel nine.
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomibuilding...
..and are holding
at least 30 people hostage.
I repeat.
Unknown number of terrorists...
..six or more
armed with automatic weapons...
..at Nakatomi Plaza,...
..Century City.
Where's the best place to transmit?
The roof!
Go! Go!
[woman] It's the same address
as that fire signal.
[2nd woman] I'll handle it.
Attention, whoever you are,...
..this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.
(McClane)No fucking shit, lady!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?
No-one kills him but me.
They have already killed one hostage.
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!
Sir, I've already told you.
This is a reserved channel.
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!
Just send the police now!
[gunshots on radio]
See if a black and white can drive by.

Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Investigate a code two
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
I'm on my way.
Girls.
[speaking German]
Shit! Where the fuck is it?
[crash]
Oh, my God.
[speaking German]
He's in the elevator shaft.
Perfect.
The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.
Just shut him in
and come back down.
Oh, fuck.
Karl, the police are probably
on their way...
..already.
Karl?
Christ.
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralised...
[clanging]
"Come out to the coast!"
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs."
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.
Such!

Karl, komm! Die polizei!
Karl, die polizei!
Well, it's about time.
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.
[Dispatch]
Roger. Possible crank call.
Check the area again and confirm.
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?
I do see a guard inside.
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.
[Dispatch] Use caution.
Eddie?
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.
Evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?
[speaking German]
We had that false alarm.
You ask me, that goddamn
computer sent you...
..on another wild-goose chase.
They been chasing bugs in this system
ever since they installed it.
[TV] ..Notre Dame on top of USC.
Aw, shit!
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?

Help yourself.

- OK! Don't shoot!
Drop that fuckin' gun!
Marco, down!
[shouting in Italian]
Ah, to hell with this!
[shouting]
You are done!
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,...
..don't hesitate.
Thanks for the advice.
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.
# Oh, the weather outside is frightful #
# Dum de dum delightful #
Oh, for the love...
[Dispatch] Go ahead.
A wild-goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.
Everything here's OK. Over.
# But nobody has no place to go #
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow #
Shit!
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!
Welcome to the party, pal!
Goddamn it!

goddamn it!
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!
I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!

Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.
I interviewed him, for God's sake.
[police radio] ..Nakatomi.
Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at...
[Powell] I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.
They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!
I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.
All of you relax.
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.
Police action was inevitable...
..and, as it happens, necessary.
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm.
This is simply the beginning.
[static]
I told you all I wanted
radio silence until...
I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.
Maybe you should have put it
on the bulletin board.
I figured since I waxed Tony
and Marco and his friend here,...
..I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely...
..so I wanted to give you a call.
[Karl] How does he know
so much about us?
That's very kind of you.
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.
You are most troublesome...
..for a security guard.
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.
Would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?
Mm, these are very bad for you.
Who are you, then?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.
The monkey in the wrench,...
..the pain in the ass.
Whoa!
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.
See if he's lying about Marco...
..and find out
if anyone else is missing.
Mr Mystery Guest,...
..are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here...
..unless you want to open
the front door for me.
No, I'm afraid not...
..but you have me at a loss.
You know my name, but who are you?
Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...
..who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.
I liked those sequined shirts.
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.
[man] Sam, I don't have the new pages.
Harvey, keep your pants on.
Sam, I'm begging you.
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.
I won't sit on this!
This is my story!
I'm going out there!
Look, Sam. Tell you what.
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.
[Harvey]
Give us a break, Thornburg.
Eat it, Harvey!
..four, three, two,...
..one.
Harvey, we're on the air.
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.
And I'm Gail Wallens.
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

on this Christmas Eve...
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.
The other man was Heinrich...
..and his bag is missing.
He had the detonator.
Theo.
Theo.
Yo!
We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?
Three down, four to go.
Then don't waste time...
..talking to me.
This is Sergeant Al Powell...
..of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
If the person who radioed for help...
..can hear me on this channel,...
..acknowledge this transmission.
I say again,...
..if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,...
..acknowledge this transmission!
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?
What's left of him.
Can you identify yourself?
Not now. Maybe later.
Listen fast. This is a party line.
The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.
All right, here's the deal.
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.
The leader's name is Hans.
We have to find him and shut him up.
He's telling them everything!
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.
He can waste
as much time as he likes...
..but we must find the bag, Fritz.
[McClane]
They have a freakin' arsenal here.
We must have the detonators.
They got missiles, automatic weapons,...
..and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.
These guys are mostly European...
..judging by their clothing labels and...
..cigarettes.
They're well-financed and very slick.
How do you know that?
I've seen enough phoney IDs in my time...
..to recognise the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means...
..but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators...
..and they're here to stay.
I hear you, partner.
LA's finest are on it,...
..so light 'em if you got 'em.
Way ahead of you, partner.
So what do I call you?
Call me...
..Roy.
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else...
..don't be shy, OK?
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.
They're all yours, Al.
Who's talking to 'em?
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?
What do these pricks want?
If you mean the terrorists,...
..we haven't heard a peep from them.
Who have you been talking to?
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.
He claims?
Powell, has it occurred to you...
..he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain...
..or some nutcase in there?
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,...
..maybe not LAPD,
But he's definitely a badge.
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said...
..like being able to spot a phoney ID.
Jesus Christ, Powell!
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!
TV's here.
Oh, shit.
[horn honks]
[officers shouting]
I have a request.
What idiot put you in charge?
You did...
..when you murdered my boss.
Now everybody's looking to me.
Personally, I'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.
Go on.
We have a pregnant woman.
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks...
..but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?
Good enough.
And unless you like it messy,...
..start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.
Yes. You're right.
It will be done.
Was there something else?
No, thank you.
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?
Gennero.
Ms Gennero.
We interrupt this programme
for a special news bulletin.
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities
whose only membership requirement
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men
seized control
of the Nakatomibuilding,
sealing off all entrances and exits.
All telephone lines have been cut
and the only communication
now possible
has been through the use
of CB communicators
which the group
apparently brought with them.
According to official sources,
the perpetrators of this building siege...
Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.
We got Charlie unit in position
by the parking structure.
Let me ask you something.
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?
Yeah.
Tell them to go ahead.
What's going on?
What's it look like? We're going in.
Going in? Man, that's crazy!
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.
We don't know shit, Powell.
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
you've been talking to on that radio.
Excuse me, sir,
but what about the body
that fell out the window?
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.
We're ready, Chief.
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!
Powell?
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?
Yo, Al.
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll talk to you later.
Al, what's wrong?
I'll talk to you later.
If you are what I think you are,
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and
and when to pray.
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?
Christ, Powell,
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.
Let's load them up.
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.
Theo, you are the eyes now.
- Rivers.
- Yo.
Begin your reconnoitre.
Let's go.
Shit!
Come on. Let's go.
Ow! Jesus!
All right, spread out.
Shut up.
Let's go.
You macho assholes. No! No!
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house
not a creature was stirring, except
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard
two-by-two cover formation.
We're all set.
We're ready.
Kick ass.
Go!
Right. Let's do it.
Take cover!
They're shooting at 'em.
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.
They're shooting at the lights.
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.
It's not happening.
Mike, burn it.
Don't be impatient.
Just wound them.
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.
They're almost in.
Send in the car.
Send in the car.
Jesus Christ!
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?
The police have themselves an RV.
Southeast corner.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Get back! Get the fuck back!
Get over there.
Schnell! Schnell!
Mach schnell!
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!
Weiter!
Mach los! Mach los!
I see him!
- Fire!
- Clear!
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
Hit it again.
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!
Let them pull back!
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.
Hit it
again.
Fire.
Fuck me.
Get them out of the car! They're burning!
Fuck it.
Mach schnell! Mach los!
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.
Geronimo, motherfucker.
Oh, shit!
They're using artillery on us!
You idiot, it's not the police.
It's him.
Holy shit.
My God!
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.
We've had an update
on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomibuilding.
Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,
may be this man... Hans Gruber.
A member of the radical
West German Volksfreimovement.
Strangely, the Volksfreileadership
issued a communiqu an hour ago
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organisation.
Al, do you copy?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
W-what was that?
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?
There you go.
Is the building on fire?
No, but it's gonna need a paintjob
and a shitload of screen doors.
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.
I don't know who you think you are
but you just destroyed a building.
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?
We don't want your help.
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?
Who the fuck is this?
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson
and I am in charge of this situation.
Oh, you're in charge?
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.
From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.
Listen to me, you little asshole...
Asshole?
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked
on national TV, Dwayne.
Ah ha ha!
Listen to me, jerk-off,
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.
Hey, look. I love you.
So do a lot of the other guys.
So hang in there, man, you hear me?
You hang in there.
Yeah, thanks, partner.
What are you doing?
I'm tired of sitting here
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,
them or your husband.
What are you going to do?
Hey, babe,
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralised already.
I don't want neutral. I want dead.
Hope I'm not interrupting.
What does he want?
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.
Look, let's be straight, OK?
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck
up here to snatch a few purses.
You're very perceptive.
I watch "60 Minutes".
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,
they're motivated, they're happening,
they want something.
I couldn't care less
about your politics.
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.
It's none of my business.
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?
You're amazing.
You figured this all out already?
Hey, business is business.
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.
What's the difference?
Let's put it in my terms.
You're here on a hostile takeover.
You grab us for some green
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.
Am I right?
Hans,
bubbie...
I'm your white knight.
I must have missed "60 Minutes".
What are you saying?
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?
I can give him to you.
Oh, God...
Roy? Roy, you all right?
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.
What do they put in these things,
anyway?
Sugar, enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,
polysorbate 60,
and yellow dye number five.
Just everything
a growing boy needs.
How many kids you got, Al?
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.
How about you, cowboy?
You got any kids
back on your ranch?
Yeah.
Two.
Sure hope I can see them
swinging on a jungle gym
with Al Jr. someday.
Well, now, that's a date
but you bring the ice cream.
[Hans] Touching, cowboy. Touching.
Or should I call you
Mr McClane?
Mr Officer John McClane
of the New York
Police Department?
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.
My friends call me John
and you're neither, shithead.
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.
A very special friend
who was with you
at the party tonight.
Hey, John boy.
Ellis?
Yeah.
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.
I know you think you're doing your job
and I can appreciate that
but you're just dragging
this thing out.
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys
can talk to the LA Police.
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?
Ellis, what have you told them?
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest
at the party.
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
Tell me about it.
All right, John, listen.
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.
They know people are listening.
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.
John, didn't you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.
John, get with the programme.
The police are here now.
It's their problem.
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!
Ellis, listen to me carefully.
John...
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!
Put Hans back on the line.
Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want
and save your friend's life.
You're not part of this equation.
Hey, what am I, a method actor?
Babe, put away the gun.
This is radio, not television.
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!
Tell them you don't know me!
How can you say that
after all these years?
John? John?
Do you hear that?
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?
Sooner or later
I might get to someone
you do care about.
Go fuck yourself, Hans.
He just let the guy die.
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?
He did everything he could
to save him.
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.
The man is hurting.
He is alone, tired,
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?
You listen to me, sergeant.
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.
Attention, police.
Attention, police.
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
Who is this?
This is Hans Gruber.
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.
We have no wish
for further loss of life.
What is it you do wish for?
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.
Now it can rattle it for me.
The following people
are to be released from their captors.
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Libert de Quebec.
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.
What the fuck?
Asian Dawn?
I read about them in "Time magazine".
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof
and they will accompany us
in helicopters
to the Los Angeles
International Airport
where they will be given
further instructions.
You have two hours to comply.
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.
Hello? Hello!
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.
Do you think they'll even try?
Who cares?
Theo, are we on schedule?
One more to go, then it's up to you.
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.
It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer
and call me
when you hit the last lock.
Karl,
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.
Fritz is checking the explosives.
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.
Hey, Powell, you out there?
I'm here, John. I'm here.
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.
I hear you.
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?
It doesn't make sense, man.
Hey, don't ask me, man.
I'm just a deskjockey
who was on my way home when you rang.
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.
In my youth. In my youth.
..author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,
A Study in Duality."
Dr Hasseldorf,
what can we expect
in the next few hours?
Well, Gail,
by this time,
the hostages should be going through
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.
As in Helsinki, Sweden.
Finland.
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists
go through a sort of
psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.
We've had situations
where the hostages
have embraced their captors
after release
and even corresponded with them
in prison.
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.
D-A-W-N.
- Sir?
- Yeah?
Sir, the FBI is here.
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.
Hold this.
Want a breath mint?
Hey, how you doing, man?
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.
I'm, uh...
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.
Not any more.
Hi, there. How you doing?
Ohh...
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?
You're one of them.
No! Don't kill me! Please!
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!
Oh, God.
What the fuck
are you doing up here?
What were you looking for?
I managed to get out of there and
I was just trying
to get up on the roof
and see if I could signal for help.
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?
Hold it. Forget the roof.
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.
The best we can figure it,
we've got maybe
probably on the 30th floor
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Such as?
What about John McClane?
He's the reason
we have any information.
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.
He's inside? Who is he?
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.
- One of yours?
- No, no way.
You smoke?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You don't work for Nakatomi.
And if you're not one of them...
I'm a cop from New York.
New York?
Yeah.
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.
Who knew?
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?
I'm John McClane.
You're, uh...
Clay.
Bill Clay.
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.
Nope.
Time for the real thing, Bill.
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.
Come on.
Put down the gun
and give me my detonators.
Well, well, well...
Hans.
Put it down now.
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.
But what do you want
with the detonators?
I already used all the explosives.
Or did I?
I'm going to count to three.
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?
Oops.
No bullets.
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
You were saying?
Karl.
Schie dem Fenster.
Shoot the glass!
Jesus Christ!
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.
..is the last resort of diplomacy,
then couldn't we just as well say
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?
Tell me you got something.
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,
and his family's home address
right here in LA.
Whoo!
Go to work.
Got it.
God, that man looks really pissed.
He's still alive.
What?
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.
Hans, you better heat up that miracle
because we just broke through
on number six
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Hey, John.
John McClane, you still with us?
Yeah.
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
Chalk up two more bad guys.
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.
We got a pool going on you.
What kind of odds am I getting?
You don't want to know.
Put me down for 20.
I'm good for it.
Hey, pal, you got flatfeet?
What the hell
are you talking about, man?
Something had
to get you off the street.
What's the matter?
You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?
No.
I had an accident.
The way you drive, I can see why.
What'd you do ?
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?
I shot a kid.
He was 13 years old.
Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop
except how to live with a mistake.
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.
Sorry, man.
Hey, man, how could you know?
I feel like shit anyway.
Well, then, this won't matter.
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.
The Feds?
You got it.
Those are the city engineers.
Wait.
They're going into the street circuits.
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.
That's the FBI.
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.
Regular as clockwork.
Or a time lock.
Precisely.
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically
in response to a terrorist incident.
You asked for miracles, Theo.
I give you the F-B-I.
I want the building shut down.
I got a problem. I got a switch...
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!
You can't do it from here.
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.
I could just... I got the radio...
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.
We're talking 10 square blocks.
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.
You have to go wider.
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?
Are you crazy?!
Maybe I should call the Mayor.
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.
Shut it down now.
Emergency lighting activated.
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?
Ask the FBI.
They got the universal
terrorist playbook
and they're running it step by step.
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
Yes!
Merry Christmas.
They must be pissing in their pants.
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.
Whoo!
What are we gonna do now?
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?
We've shut them down.
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.
Right up the ass.
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.
Oh, yes!
I wish to talk to the FBI.
This is Special Agent Johnson.
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.
I hear you. We'll be ready.
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.
Ah! Jeez!
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
I'm here, John.
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.
I want you to do something for me.
Um... ahem...
I want you to find my wife.
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.
I want you to tell her that...
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out
what a jerk I've been
but, um...
that...
that when things started
to pan out for her
I should have been more supportive.
And, uh...
I just should have been
behind her more.
Oh, shit.
Tell her that, um
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.
She never heard me say I'm sorry.
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.
OK?
You got that, man?
Yeah, I got it, John.
But you can tell her that yourself.
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.
John?
John?
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?
John?
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.
I gotta go check on something.
One minute, that's all I'm asking.
One minute to speak to them.
All right. Get back. Get back.
All right, look.
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have
to speak to their parents.
All right?
All right. Come on. Come on.
What were you doing, Hans?
What were you doing?
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!
The roof is wired to...
John?
John!
John, come in!
Did you get that?
Something about a double-cross.
Tell me about it.
We are both professionals.
This is personal.
Aww...
They're coming!
Choppers are coming.
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.
Your mom and dad
are very important people.
They're very brave people.
Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?
Come home.
Mrs McClane.
How nice to make your acquaintance.
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
Lock them up there
and come right back.
You should have heard
your brother squeal
when I broke his fucking neck!
What do you figure the breakage?
I figure we take out the terrorists,
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.
I can live with that.
Get this thing on the deck.
They're expecting transports,
not gunships.
Move it! Come on! Move!
Come on! Come on!
Move it!
Go! Move!
Theo.
A little bonus for us.
Please, sit down. Sit down!
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.
McClane, I have some news for you.
McClane?
Move!
Come on!
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!
Armed.
- The truck?
- The truck.
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,
you're nothing but a common thief.
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!
I don't like this, Sarge.
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?
I was in Junior High, dickhead.
Where's Holly?
Where's Holly Gennero?
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?
Where's Holly? Where is she?
- They took her!
- Where?
The vault!
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!
They just took her!
Get downstairs!
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!
Get down!
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.
Break left!
Nail that sucker!
I'm on your side, you assholes!
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.
What the fuck...
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!
Blow the roof!
I promise I will never even think
about going up
in a tall building again.
Oh, God, please don't let me die!
Holy Christ!
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Fuck!
What the fuck is going on?
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?
Shit!
All right!
Hey! Hey!
Hang on, baby.
Hang on, honey.
Oh, God.
Hans!
Jesus.
Hi, honey.
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?
Put down the gun.
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you
unless they think
you're already dead.
Put down the gun.
Nein. This is mine.
You got me.
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.
Americans... all alike.
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.
Enough jokes.
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
Holly!
Happy trails, Hans.
- Aah!
- Holly.
I hope that's not a hostage.
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.
Over here. It's a better angle.
Let's give them a hand.
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?
Al, this is my wife Holly.
Holly Gennero.
Holly McClane.
Hello, Holly.
You got yourself a good man.
You take good care of him.
McClane!
McClane, I want a debriefing!
You got some things
to answer for, mister.
Ellis' murder, for one thing.
Property damage,
interfering with police business.
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!
No. This one's with me.
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,
what are your feelings?
Well, well, well.
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.
Did you get that?
Let me through.
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.



Oh, hello.
You're, uh, you're probably here
About the, Uh, the story.
Elves love to tell stories.
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.
There's, uh, probably a lot of things
You... you didn't know about elves.
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.
The first is making shoes at night
While, you know, while the old...
The old cobbler sleeps.
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.
You can bake cookies
In a tree. Hey!
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven
In an oak tree during the dry season.
I wanna make shoes!
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"
It's the professin that every elf
Aspires to,
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.
Only two weeks left till Christmas!
I- It's a job only an elf can do.
Our... our nimble fingers,
Natural cheer and active minds
Are perfect for toy-building.
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,
But the gnomes drank too much...
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,
And, as you may have guessed,
That's where our story begins.
Wow!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Wow!
Wow!
Ow! Ow!
Whoa!
Are you sleepy?
Here we are.
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.
Here we are.
There you are.
It's time to go to sleep.
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.
Merry Christmas, my ngel.
Mmm...
All right, all right.
We've had another very successful
year.
So, after all that hard work,
It's time to start preparations
For next Christmas!
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?
Wow...
A baby...
"little buddy diapers."
His name is buddy. He must've...
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.
What do we do?
So, Santa had a
Decisin to make,
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,
Santa's a... a pushover.
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf
Who had always wanted a child?
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.
Santa.
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.
I was his adopted father.
Though buddy grew twice as fast,
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.
I mean, not... not really.
Before we learn how to build
The latest
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"
Shall we?
Number one.
"Treat every day like Christmas."
Number two.
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."
Number three.
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer
Is singing loud for all to hear."
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,
I made him my own personal
apprentice.
I've never been in this room
before.
Well, I think it's time you start
Your tinker training.
Santa's sleigh.
You're gonna help me make it fly.
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.
Well, silly as it sounds,
A lot of people down south
Don't believe in Santa Claus.
What?!
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?
Well, there's a rumor floating around
That, uh, that the parents do it.
That's... that's ridiculous.
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.
What about Santa's cookies?
I suppose parents eat them, too?
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,
Uh, and every earless and less
People
Believe in Santa Claus.
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.
Oh.
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.
That's shocking.
That's why I came up
With this little beauty in the '60s.
WH-what is it?
It's a cringle 3000...
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.
Without it, the sleigh couldn't
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.
Well, it looks like we got
A short in the thermo coupler.
You wanna give mea hand with that?
You want me to help?
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted
By his family and friends,
There were a few drawbacks
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's worid.
Hey, Ming Ming.
Um...
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.
It's all right, buddy.
Just how many etch-a-sketches
Did you get finished?
Come on, buddy. How many?
I made, uh... 85.
Eighty-five?
That puts you...
Ooh... that's bad.
Why don't you just say it?
I'm the worst toy maker in
the worid.
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.
We all just have different talents
That's all.
Seems like everyone else
Have the same talents
except for me.
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...
Special talents?
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.
You sure did... aaa's.
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...
Won't he?
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.
You bring us down whole octave.
In a good way.
See, buddy?
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.
You're just... special.
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.
Aah!
Ah!
Hey, foom foom...
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?
No problem. I appreciate it.
Buddy is killing me.
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.
That was quick thinking yesterday
With that special talents thing.
Ming Ming: I feel bad for the guy.
I just hope he doesn't get wise.
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,
I don't think he ever will.
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human
By now, I don't think he ever will.
I think they're too small.
You're just... special.
You don't look so good, buddy.
Are you okay?
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.
Aah!
Buddy...
Unh! Aah!
Buddy, are you okay?
I'm sorry, papa.
I just need some alone time.
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.
Buddy, uh, I think there's something
I... I probably should tell you.
You probably should have found
out a long...
A long time ago.
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father
Had fallen in love when he was
very young
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,
And how buddy was born
And put up for adoption by
his mother,
And how she had later passed away.
I... I told him his father
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,
And most importantly,
I told him where his father was...
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.
My dad works there?
Empire state building.
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?
Not now, arctic puffin.
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.
Why the long face, partner?
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"
And had a beard since you were 15.
Papa says my real father
Lives in a magical place far away.
I don't know what to do.
At least you have a daddy.
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.
Buddy, I've been around the worid
Many times
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...
Except dogs.
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.
Oh, I know that.
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity
To find out whom you really are.
So, I hear you're going
On a little journey to
the big city.
Yup. Ahh.
I'm kind a nervous.
Leon says New York is pretty
different.
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.
I've been to New York thousands
of times.
Really? Mm-hmm.
What's it like?
Well, there are some things you
should know.
First off, you see gum on
The street,
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.
Oh. Second,
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.
They all claim to be the
Original,
But the real one' son 11th.
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you
Look at presents before Christmas.
Can't wait to see my dad...
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.
Yeah, that's the other thing
I wanted to talk to you about.
You know, buddy...
Your father...
Well... he's on the naughty list.
No!
You're taking the books back?
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,
When, in actuality, you're the one
That missed the payments.
But the children love the books.
I know that, uh...
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,
But I like hearing that.
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight
Of what's important in life.
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?
Maybe all they need
Is just a little Christmas spirit.
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.
I know you are.
And I'll...
I'll always, uh,
I'll always be here for you.
Now, uh...
Go... uh, get.
Bye, guys.
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, buddy.
There, there.
Huh?
Oh! Ohh!
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.
Bye.
Hey! What's your name?
My name's buddy.
Ohh!
Does someone need a hug?
aah, aah! That's not cool!
I just wanted a hug!
Hi.
Hello.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You did it! Congratulations!
"Worid's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.
It's great to meet you.
Hi.

Not Santa.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.
No, all right? Thank you.
Get outta here, get outta here.
Hello. Hi.
Ooh...
Beautiful.
Looks like a Christmas tree.
A reprint?
You know how much that's gonna
cost?
Two whole pages are missing.
The story doesn't make any sense.
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never
Declared kittens before.
How many?
Eight?
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.
I have to go. Excuse me.
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs
You look hilarious! Who sent you?
Papa elf. Papa elf?
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.
From the North Pole? Yes.
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath
So some kid can understand
What happened?
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon
ship 'em.
Yeah.
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.
Go ahead.
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.
Dad!
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.
I walked all day and night to
Find you.
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.
That's exactly where I came from.
Santa must've called you!
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...
Just got off the cell phone
with me.
You did?!
So, go on. Go on with what?
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,
Or can I just go back to work?
A song? Uh...
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad
And we never met
And he wants me to sing
Him a song
And, um, I was adopted
But you didn't know I was born
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy
And, guess what? I love you
I love you I love you!
Wow, that was weird.
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.
It's me, your son.
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,
And, and, and, but now I'm here...
It's me buddy.
Susan wells.
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.
Who sent this Christmas-gram?
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.
It's okay, Walter's my father.
Well, your dad's busy right now.
Okay, I'll come back later.
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna
Come back for awhile, okay?
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.
Okay.
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?
Sorry! Sorry.
Passin fruit spray?
Fruit spray? Sure.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Do you wanna go?
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?
They're gl-normous!
"For that special someone."
Past!
Grunts
Hey, come... come here!
Me? Yes.
What are you doing down here?
You're not supposed to be
Down here!
You can shop on your break,
You don't... come on, get upstairs!
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!
Are you mad at me? No.
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.
Just do your job.
Okay, fair enough.

This is the North Pole.
No, it's not. Yes, it is.
No, it's not. Yes, it is.
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.
No, it's not. Where's the snow?
Why you smiling like that?
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?
Okay. Work is your new favorite.
Fine.
It's time for the announcement.
Okay.

Santa!
Oh, my god!

I know him.
He'll be hereto take pictures
With all the children.
Yeah!
Just keep your receipts.
Santa's coming to town.
Yes. Can you sign this for me?
Ohh! Hi.
Are you enjoying the view?
You are very good at decorating
that tree.
Why are you messing with me?
Did krumpet put you up to this?
I'm not messing with you.
It's just nice to meet
Another human
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.
Get through?
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide worid!
Please stop talking to me.
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.
Go away.
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer
Is singing loud for all to hear.
Thanks, but I don't sing.
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...
Except louder and longer
And you move your voice up
And down.
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.
Especially in front of other
people.
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing
In front of other people. There's
no difference.
Actually, there's a big difference.
No, there... no, there isn't.
Wait.
I'm singing
I'm in a store, and I'm singing
I'm in a store, and I'm singing
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.
Yes, there is.
No, there's not.
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.
Especially when we make toys.
See?
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,
Please make your final purchases.
We'll be closing in ten minutes.
Well, it's time for me to go home.
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.
Yeah, um... laughs
I'll see you tomorrow...
Buddy. Jovie.
Hi. Hi.
Jovie.
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?
I, uh, I got
A bunch of stuff to go over.
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind
On a bunch of stuff.
Okay.
Can I eat in my room?
No. Why not?
Dad's eating in his room.
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.
You're eating here.
I really can't stay
I've got to go 'way
This evening has been
So very nice
My mother will start to worry
And father will be pacing'
The floor
So, really, I'd better scurry
Well, may be just a half a drink
More
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?
I really can't stay
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!
Get out! Don't look at me!
Get out!
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling
Ring-ting-tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together
With you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Dad?
Come on, its lovely weather dad.
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow
Hey! It's okay,
I just have a gift for my dad.
Okay, I'll take this.
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?
Okay. And that I love him so much,
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the worid.
You guys are so strong.
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather
Would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together
With you
Hey, you. Me?
Come here. I wanna talk to you.
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?
How come you were
In the women's locker room these
morning?
I heard you singing.
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact
That I was naked in the shower?
I didn't know you were naked.
Why were you here so early?
They shut my water off.
What were you doing here so
early?
Building this.
You built this? Mm-hmm.
They're kind a pissed about
this.
Really?
Hey, guys.
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?
'Cause if I go, we all go.
If you get wind of anything,
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"
Okay?
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.
That's impossible. Six... inches.
By the way... I think you have
The most beautiful singing voice
In the whole wide worid.
Santa...
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!
Yeah!
Santa, it's me buddy!
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?
It's me!
Are you ready to see Santa?
Who the heck are you?
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.
No, you're not.
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Well, if you're Santa...
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?
Uh, happy birthday of course!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Uh, so, how old are you, son?
Four.
You're a big boy, what's
your name?
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.
You sit on a throne of lies.
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.
I'm a fake? Yes.
How'd you like to be dead, huh?
Fake. No, he's kidding.
You stink.
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?
You smell like beef and cheese.
You don't smell like Santa.
Okay.
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!
I saw!
He's a fake!
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?
Ohh! Ohh!
No!
He's not Santa Claus!
He's not Santa!
"To someone special."
What's that? Intercom.
All right.
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.
Police. Hello?
Dad!
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.
Officer tom, this is my dad.
This is Walter... he came.
He bailed me out.
They gave me one phone call.
They gave me one phone call,
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...
Walter Hobbs."
And sure enough, you showed up.
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.
Wait, um...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...
Where'd you get this picture?
Papa elf gave it to me.
Listen... is this some kind a
game?
What do you want, some money?
No! I just wanted to meet you,
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...
And maybe even hold hands.
Uh-huh.
Come with me. Okay.
Okay. What have we got here?
Buddy, don't eat those.
Ohh!
We got to really hurry up, Walter,
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.
Am I sick?
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.
We're hereto do a test, come on.
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.
Finger prick!
Ohh! It's cold.
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.
Could you please have him?
Sit still?
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.
I have a lot of patients
waiting.
Would you please it still?
Please.
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can
Get this mess over with.
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.
Ow! Ohh...
My finger has a heartbeat.
It won't hurt so much after
a little.
What's your name?
Buddy.
I'm Carolyn.
Hi.
What do you want for Christmas?
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.
Well, technically, I'm a human,
But I was raised by elves.
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.
Hmm. Cool.
So?
It's a boy... buddy's your son.
That's very impossible.
You... you saw that guy out there.
He's... he's certifiably insane.
He's probably just reverting
To a state of childlike
dependency.
An elf?
What he needs is to be nurtured.
Oh, I see.
So, um, uh...
You'd like me to breastfeed him?
Walter, just bring him home.
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...
This is wonderful,
You... you have another son.
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.
This is incredible, I...
You know, it's a little
complicated,
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.
Honey? What?
He thinks he's an elf.
I'm sorry, what?
He think she's a Christmas elf.
Oh, come on, Walter,
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels
Of the candy cane forest,
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.
Ahh.
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?
The north pole.
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.
Yes.
You like sugar, huh?
Is there sugar in syrup?
Yes.
Then yes.
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?
You mean I can stay?
Of course you can. Emily.
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,
But I was thinking, like...
forever.
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute
in the, uh, kitchen, please?
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.
Clearly he has some serious issues.
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.
Why not? He loves the snow.
He's told me 15 times.
Walter, he's your son.
Did you hear that?
You are so weird.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
What?
What?
I am not gonna tuck you in.
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.
Fine.
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Hey, uh...
You just lay there and go to
sleep.
Okay.
Okay.
Dad? Hmm?
I love you.
Okay. Go to sleep now.
Well, this is really something.
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.
That's good, that's good.
Okay.
Oh, that's good.
Good? Good.
Good.
So, did you, um...
Did you sleep okay last night?
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?
Where did you get all the wood?
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.
Isn't that nice?
And lunch.
And lunch.
Bye.
So, dad, how many scoops?
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.
So, dad...
I planned out our whole day.
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.
I've got to go to work, buddy.
Oh, and another thing...
If you're going to be staying
here,
You should think about, you know,
Getting rid of the costume.
But I've worn this my whole life.
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.
You wanna make me happy, don't you?
More than anything.
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.
As soon as possible?
As soon as possible.
Okay.
I almost forgot...
Aah! Aah!
Good morning.
Walter here.
It worked, it's you.
How'd you get this number?
Emily left an emergency list.
I see.
And, uh, is this an emergency?
There's a horrible noise
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.
It sounds like this...
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,
It's, uh, it's a radiator,
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.
Everything's fine.
You were right.
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.
I love you.
I'll call you in five minutes.
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?
Good idea, you call me.
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.
I tuned the piano.
Okay, I love you. Bye.
Mmm...
Mmm... Mmm.
Mmm.
Hobbs. Hey!
How you doing? Please, sit
down.
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.
You're looking good.
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.
She wants to know
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.
Believe me, uh,
We're already looking for new
printers.
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.
That's your signature, right?
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.
I've got news for you...
Even if those two pages were
in there,
The book still would have sucked.
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.
That frigging puppy and pigeon
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.
My people estimate we're
gonna post
A minus eight for this quarter.
A minus eight! That does not
happen!
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...
No, no, no. No? Well...
We're gonna ship a new book
The first quarter.
First quarter?
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.
At that time, I would love
to hear
In exact detail
What your plans are for this
new book.
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.
And?
And, uh...
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.
I got full health, I got full
armor.
Michael!
I got full...
Michael!
It's me buddy!
You know that guy?
No, I've never seen him before.
It's me buddy! Your brother!
Oh, man.
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks
Michael! Michael!
Michael!
Michael, wait up!
Michael! Michael!
Wow, you're fast.
I'm gladi caught up with you.
I waited five hours for you.
Why is your coat so big?
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.
How was school? Was it fun?
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?
Do you have any friends?
Do you have a best friend?
Does he have a big coat, too?
Go away!
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!
Run!
Get him! Get the
green guy!
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.
We better get outta here.
You know what? We can take 'em.
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.
You ready?
Let's go. Aah! Ow.
Ow!
Run!
Oh, man. One got away.
Snowball.
Unh!
Wow.
Where did you say you were from?
Oh, yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door
All these things and more
I wish dad were here.
Why?
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide worid.
Are you kidding?
He's the worst dad in the worid.
What do you mean?
All he does is work.
Working's fun.
Not the way he does it.
All he cares about is money.
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.
Well, he is on the naughty list.
You like her?
Like who?
The girl you're staring at.
Oh, uh...
Yeah.
Why don't you ask her out?
Out?
You know, on a date...
to eat food.
Food?
Yes, real food, not candy.
And if she says yes,
you're in.
It's like a secret code
giris have.
Well, look who it is.
Hi, Jovie. Hi.
Oh, uh, this is Michael.
I'm his brother.
Hi.
So, what are you doing here?
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?
No. But things worked out
pretty good.
They gave mea restraining
order.
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.
Ho ho ho!
But... I really wanted to
see you,
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...
I feel really warm when I
am around you,
And, um, my tongue swells up.
So...
Do you wanna go eat food?
Do I... do I wanna eat food?
Mm-hmm.
You know, uh, the code... food.
Well, I just had my lunch
break.
Oh, okay. I understand.
But I'm free on Thursday.
Thursday! Thursday!
Come on. That'd be great.
All right.
Was that okay?
You did great, man.
What should we put on it
first?
Lights! Oh, good.
And then, after that?
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.
What the hell's that?
A Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree?
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.
Emily.
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.
They were just having a
little fun.
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.
Okay, the tree thing was bad.
I'll get him to plant
another one.
But at least Michael is
happy for once.
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,
Deranged elf man raise him?
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.
How are we gonna get the star
on top?
I got it.
I mean, what are we gonna do?
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.
He's gonna destroy the place.
Why don't you, um...
Why don't you take off tomorrow?
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.
Well, honey, I can't take off,
I'm one... one bad pitch away
From getting fired... one.
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.
Morning, jack.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."
Hi! Hi.
Do you remember me?
I do. I didn't recognize you.
I know, I'm in work clothes.
Thank you, Deborah.
Thanks, deb.
Deb, you have such a pretty face.
You should be on a Christmas card.
You just made my day.
Eww.
Buddy. Hmm?
You don't have to drink that.
Thank you.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Buddy?
Just... just a little.
Yes, bud?
Why is your name on the desk?
I bought the desk.
My name's there so no one
steals it.
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.
So, what are we gonna build?
No, uh, we don't do
That kind of work here, pal.
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?
Put that down. Hello?
Hello? Dial tone
Please, don't touch anything.
Sorry.
Hey...
Bud, have you... have you...
Have you ever seen a mailroom?
A mailroom? No.
No? No.
Oh, I mean, wow.
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail
From all over the worid
comes,
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?
And you can touch it all,
And they put it in these
shiny bins.
Shiny bins? Right.
What do ya think? It
sounds great.
Good.
Can we go there?
Well, um...
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.
Okay, I'll work there.
Oh, I don't think this is
the place
My dad was talking about.
Is there a different mailroom?
No. This is the only one.
It's not very shiny.
Now... over here's the trench.
All the mail comes out that
shooter.
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.
Put it in a canister
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.
You got that?
I think so.
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.
Except it smells like mushrooms,
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,
So, what... what do we got?
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,
And we've come up with what I
think
Is a pretty big idea.
Great, what?
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.
What?
Okay, picture this...
We bring in miles finch.
The miles finch?
The golden ghost.
We bring him in!
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.
I tain't gonna be easy,
But I think it's worth a shot.
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...
You came in here pitching me
The idea of hiring another writer?
Yeah.
Miles finch.
I like it. Chuckles
I like it.
Then I traveled through the seven
levels
Of the candy cane forest
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.
Ooh!
Wow... it's sucky.
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!
That is marvelous how that...
Oh!
Oh, it's very sucky.
It's very... sucky.
Whoo.
So, how'd you get here?
Work release.
Mm.
Oh, syrup and coffee?
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?
Be my guest.
Very generous of you.
Mmm. I love syrup.
Ohh, I love it.
Mmm...
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,
But we are buddies.
You're my best friend, that's it.
You're my best friend.
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.
You have great ideas.
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?
Good, you go with the flow.
Yeah. Go with the flow.
No, I gotta get out of the flow.
Well, then get out of the flow.
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.
You're young. You're so young.
My papa... yeah?
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you
On our speakerphone.
Miles, um, so, what do you think?
Can you fly in tomorrow?
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,
Not a minute more.
Oh, that's... that's great.
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.
I need the interior of that car
To be 71 degrees exactly.
We can do that. Deborah: Mr. Hobbs?
There's a situation downstairs.
I'm sorry, what?
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.
We have a problem in the
mailroom.
What's going on?
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.
Sir, chuck in the mailroom
Needs to talk to you.
Chuck... what, chuck?
I mean, what could be going on
down there
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp! There it is
Upside down and inside out hey!
I'm 'bout to show all you folks
What it's all about hey!
Time for me to get on the mike
And make this mother of a party
hype
I'm taking you back to the old
school
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp! There it is a little louder
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp, there it is!
Coming.
Hi.
Wow.
You look miraculous.
So do you.
Thank you.
What would you like to do?
I got some ideas.
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.
Don't look. There you go.
Well?
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.
No.
It is a crappy cup of coffee.
No, it's the worid's best cup
of coffee.
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!
what are you doing?
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.
Now, look at the size of this one.
Come with me.
Watch out.
Yellow ones don't stop.
The yellow ones don't stop.
Wow... that's a big one.
I'm sorry.
You missed.
What do you mean I missed?
You missed.
Miles finch.
Miles finch.
Miles finch.
All right, let's do this.
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...
Yeah.
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...
Taken care of so we can get started
here.
Here you go.
Great.
All right... clears throat
What have you guys got so far?
Go ahead.
Uh...
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...
We open on a young tomato.
He's had some tough times down
at the farm
With, you know, a rabbit, and...
No. No tomatoes...
Too vulnerable.
Kids, they're already vulnerable.
No, you see? I... I told you guys.
I told them the very same thing...
And no farms.
Every body's pushing small town
rural.
A farm book would just be white
noise.
What about this?
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.
I have no time, so, you know,
If you've got a story here...
I've got about five or six great
starts here.
I've got one idea that
I'm especially
Psyched out of my mind about.
You know, it's one of those ideas
Where you're just like, uh...
Yes!
Whoa!
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,
And I don't care who knows it!
Buddy, not now, uh,
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?
I didn't know you had elves
working here.
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.
He doesn't, uh... get back to
The story, please. All right, okay.
So, on the cover above the title...
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?
Buddy... go back to the basement.
Hey, jack weed,
I get more action in a week
Than you've had your entire life.
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,
Oh. Each one of them
with a 70-inchplasma screen.
So, I suggest you wipe
That stupid smile off your face
Before I come over there and smack
it off!
You feeling strong, my friend?!
Call me elf one more time!
He's an angry elf.
Look at you.
Ow! Hey, what...
Aah!
I wasn't ready for that.
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!
Ooh...
Call me elf one more time!
Call me elf!
You're an elf.
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.
Listen, miles...
Listen, miles! Door slams
He must be a South Pole elf.
You get the hell outta here.
Where do you want me to go?
I don't care where you go.
I don't care that you're an elf!
I don't care that you're nuts!
I don't care that you're my son!
Get out of my life now!
Hi, it's me.
I really can't talk right now.
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?
Well, don't be too late, Walter,
It's Christmas Eve.
Walter... wait, um.
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.
Oh, say hi to buddy.
What? Walter, breakthrough.
We found this in the conference
room.
What is it?
It's miles finch's notebook.
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.
I mean, look at that.
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?
What, uh, what do we do?
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.
Uh, how much time we got?
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.
Come on, let's do it. Just try.
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.
Go and get a storyboard ready.
Oh, boy! Go.
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."
God...
Hey, buddy.
Buddy?
As you know, we need a big
launch fast
To get the company back on
track.
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members
When I say... this better be good.
Before I get into the story, uh,
Let me start with the cover, okay?
Now, just picture this...
Dad! I gotta talk to you.
Walter: Michael, what is it?
Buddy ran away.
What? He... he left a note.
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.
All you care about is yourself.
Hey, Michael.
Wait.
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.
We don't have time to reschedule.
I wanna hear the damn thing now.
Son, you'll have to wait.
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?
I flew in just to hear this pitch,
And I intend to.
It's gonna have to wait.
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,
You will pitch me this book
right now.
Well... up yours.
Yeah, up yours. Hey.
Hobbs... Hobbs!
Hobbs, you walk out of here,
And... and you're finished at
greenway!
You're finished!
I don't belong anywhere.
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy, where are you?!
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!
Vixen, up, up!
Santa?
Come on, you can do it.
Pull up! Pull up!
Dad! What?
Michael, where you going?
Michael!
Santa.
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.
Buddy, is that you?
Are you okay?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.
And then the strain was too
Much...
The engine broke free of her
mounts.
I need an elf's help.
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.
I... I can't do anything right.
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,
And the only one who I would want
Working on my sleigh tonight.
Really? Really.
Will you fix it for me, buddy?
I'll try. Papa taught me how.
You gotta find it first.
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.
The engine? The engine, yeah.
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!
I'm standing here outside
central park
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.
What we do know is that
authorities
Have closed the park
And are in the process of
clearing it.
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.
I've got an eyewitness with me
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.
What did you actually see?
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.
Oh, your daughter saw it?
Sweetheart, can you tell me
What you saw falling out of the
sky?
It was Santa's sleigh!
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.
Santa's in Manhattan.
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,
But New York one has just received
Some exclusive amateur news footage
That you just might Anna follow
up on.
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf
Wandering through central park.
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,
News is top priority.
What the heck...?
Hey!
You found it. Buddy!
I need to tell you something.
No, no. Buddy, there's something
I have to tell you right now.
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.
I know you may be a little, um, um...
Uh, chemically imbalanced,
But you've been right about a lot
of things.
I... I don't want you to leave.
You're my son, and I... love you.
Uh, buddy, uh...
What was it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, right. Come with me.
Right. Come on.
I'm herewith another eyewitness
Who has his own versin of what
happened.
Sir, what did you see?
I think you're great, charlotte.
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky
Right into the middle of central
park.
I mean, you're a great news lady.
Thank you.
Could you tell me a bit more?
About what you saw fall from the
sky?
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.
Dick, uh, according to authorities,
The area has been cleared.
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.
These forces are highly trained,
But rarely see action.
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho
When called into duty,
And their controversial crowd
control tactics
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85
Are still under investigation.
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.
That ta boy.
So, uh... you're, uh...
Santa Claus. Right.
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?
Sure.
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?
That ta boy, thank you.
So, you're really Santa Claus?
You never can tell, kid.
Tell me, Michael,
What do you want for Christmas?
I wanted a skateboard.
Oh, not just skateboard.
Arealhuf board. Looked here.
Looked here...
How do you like them apples?
Go look and see.
Whoa.
What happened?
You made my sleigh fly.
What do you mean?
Well, before the turbine days,
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,
And everyone will believe in you,
Then your sleigh will fly, right?
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.
If the whole worid saw me,
all would be lost.
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.
Hey, look!
Oh, no.
It's the central park rangers.
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.
Santa: Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!
Come on, give me your hat and coat.
Mrs. Claus made them for me.
Hey! Hey, here I am!
Ho ho ho!
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.
So the authorities have not
discovered
Any reindeer in the park?
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?
No, no sleigh bells, either.
Elves? Excuse me, please.
None of that, we really just
need everyone...
It's him, it's the real Santa!
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!
Charlotte: Did you see something
in the park?
Everyone out there,
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.
Look, this is his list!
Okay... well, further confirmation
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.
We have the naughty and nice list.
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff
giris play set.
Mark weber wants an electric
guitar.
Yes!
Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzy-
talks-a-lot.

It's the real Santa.
We need to get these cameras
back on.
He needs our help!
Hey, Michael, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,
The sleigh won't fly
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.
Michael! Mom!
Michael! Ohh!
Are you okay? I'm fine.
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer
Is singing loud for all
to hear.
Buddy... better get going,

Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!
Can't wait!
On, dasher, on, dancer...

You know, he wasn't lying.
Merry Christmas.

Stop messing around and get in!
Aah!

I put the mon the naughty list,
And they never forgave me.
You better watch out,

You better not pout,

We're toast!
Well, still no sign of Santa,
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling
Has broken out
Right herein front of central
park.
Let's have a listen in.
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows if you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or
good
So be good for goodness sake
Hey!
You better watch out, you better
not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why
Come on!
Santa clausis coming' to town
Santa: Just a little more!
Hal-yah!
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've
Wait... you're not singing.

your lips.
Santa!

Dad.
I'm telling you why
Santa clausis coming to town
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Now, my beauties!
Bye-bye.
Just like the old days!
Charlotte? Charlotte?
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure
What happened this Christmas Eve?
In central park.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
Ho ho ho!
And so, with a little help,
Buddy managed to save Christmas.
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.
His first book was written by a
brand new,
Critically acclaimed children's
author.
The book was elf...
A, uh, fictional story
About an adopted elf named buddy
Who was raised in the North Pole?
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,
Worked in a shiny mailroom,
And eventually saved Christmas.
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels
"Of the candy cane forest,
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."
And as for me, I can't complain.
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.
In the meadow we can build a
snowman
And pretend that he is parson
brown
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.
You're welcome, papa.
But you can do the job when
you're in town
Hey, Suzie.
Come here, little one.
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?
Papa wants to see you.
Though your nose get a
little chilling
Buddy...
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a
snowman
And pretend that he is parson
brown
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans
That we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
I really can't stay
But, baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
But, baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So, really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that
storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at
the door
Waves upon tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, your lips look delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a pleasure before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty
implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get rid of that hold out
Ah, but it's cold
Outside

Hey. I'm creatin' scarcity.

Drives the prices up.



  

                   

Rizzo...



  

                   

Hello! Welcome to

The Muppet Christmas Carol.



  

                   

- I am here to tell the story.

- And I am here for the food.



  

                   

- My name is Charles Dickens.

- And my name is Rizzo the Rat.



  

                   

Hey. Wait a second.

You're not Charles Dickens.



  

                   

- I am too!

- No.



  

                   

A blue. Furry Charles Dickens

who hangs out with a rat?



  

                   

- Absolutely!

- Dickens was a   th-century novelist.



  

                   

- A genius!

- Oh. You're too kind.



  

                   

Why should I believe you?



  

                   

Well. Because I know the story

of"A Christmas Carol"

like the back of my hand.



  

                   

- Prove it!

- All right.



  

                   

Um. There's a little mole on my thumb

and. Uh. A scar on my wrist...



  

                   

- From when I fell off my bicycle.

- No. No. No. No.



  

                   

Don't tell us your hand.

Tell us the story.



  

                   

Oh. Oh. Thank you. Yes.



  

                   

The Marleys were dead to begin with.



  

                   

- Wha- Wha... Pardon me?

- That's how the story begins. Rizzo.



  

                   

The Marleys were dead to begin with.

as dead as a doornail.



  

                   

It's a good beginning.

It's creepy and kind of spooky.



  

                   

- Oh. Thank you. Rizzo.

- You're welcome. Mr Dickens.



  

                   

In life. The Marleys

had been business partners...



  

                   

with a shrewd moneylender

named Ebenezer Scrooge.



  

                   

You will meet him

as he comes around that corner.



  

                   

- Where?

- There.



  

                   

- When?

- Now.



  

                   

There he is.

Mr Ebenezer Scrooge.



  

                   

Say. Is it gettin' colder out here?



  

                   

When a cold wind blows

it chills you



  

                   

Chills you to the bone



  

                   

But there's nothing in nature that freezes

your heart like years of being alone



  

                   

It paints you with indifference



  

                   

Like a lady paints with rouge



  

                   

- And the worst of the worst

- The most hated and cursed



  

                   

Is the one that we call Scrooge



  

                   

- Unkind as any

- And the wrath of many



  

                   

This is Ebenezer Scrooge



  

                   

Oh, there goes Mr Humbug



  

                   

There goes Mr Grimm



  

                   

If they gave a prize

for bein'mean



  

                   

The winner would be him



  

                   

Old Scrooge, he loves his money

'cause he thinks it gives him power



  

                   

If he became a flavour

you can bet he would be sour



  

                   

Even the vegetables

don't like him.



  

                   

There goes Mr Skinflint

There goes Mr Greed



  

                   

The undisputed master

of the underhanded deed



  

                   

He charges folks a fortune

for his dark and draughty houses



  

                   

Us poor folk live in misery



  

                   

It's even worse for mouses



  

                   

Please. Sir.

I want some cheese.



  

                   

He must be so lonely

He must be so sad



  

                   

He goes to extremes

to convince us he's bad



  

                   

He's really a victim

of fear and of pride



  

                   

Look close and there must be

a sweet man inside



  

                   

- Nah.

- Uh-uh.



  

                   

There goes Mr Outrage



  

                   

There goes Mr Sneer



  

                   

He has no time for friends or fun



  

                   

His anger makes that clear



  

                   

Don't ask him for a favour

'cause his nastiness increases



  

                   

No crust of bread for those in need



  

                   

No cheeses for us meeces



  

                   

Scrooge liked the cold.



  

                   

He was hard and sharp as a flint...



  

                   

secretive. Self-contained.

as solitary as an oyster.



  

                   

There goes Mr Heartless



  

                   

There goes Mr Cruel



  

                   

He never gives

He only takes



  

                   

He lets his hunger rule



  

                   

If being mean's a way of life



  

                   

You practise and rehearse



  

                   

Then all that work is paying off

'cause Scrooge is getting worse



  

                   

Every day in every way

Scrooge is getting worse



  

                   

- Oh. Boy!

- How the time flies! Look at this.



  

                   

- I've got to go.

- What happened?



  

                   

Hey. Guys. What happened?



  

                   

Humbug.



  

                   

What an unpleasant fella!



  

                   

He was a tightfisted hand

at the grindstone. Scroo...



  

                   

- Boy. This really is a dirty city.

- You're telling me!



  

                   

- Come here.

- Hmm?



  

                   

Thank you for making me

a part of this.



   

                   

He was a tightfisted hand

at the grindstone. Scrooge...



   

                   

a squeezing.

wrenching. Grasping...



   

                   

clutching. Covetous old sinner.



   

                   

- Bob Cratchit?

- Yes. Mr Scrooge?



   

                   

- Who is this?

- It's Mr Applegate. Sir.



   

                   

He's here to speak to you

about his mortgage.



   

                   

Please. Mr Scrooge.

I know you're very angry about this.



   

                   

And I didn't mean to fall behind

in the payments.



   

                   

Lord knows.

it being Christmas and all.



   

                   

Please don't shout at me. Sir.



   

                   

That and. Of course. Little Gwen.

Her lungs aren't right.



   

                   

The doctor takes his share. Don't he?



   

                   

I mean. You can yell and scream and

you're right. But it won't do no good...



   

                   

because I'm the stone

you can't squeeze blood from.



   

                   

And that's the truth!



   

                   

Thank you for not shouting at me.



   

                   

- Seventy-two...

- Seventy-four...



   

                   

Let us deal with the eviction notices

for tomorrow. Mr Cratchit.



   

                   

- Tomorrow is Christmas. Sir.

- Very well.



   

                   

You may gift-wrap them.



   

                   

- Let us help you with that. Mr Cratchit.

- Oh. My. There are certainly a lot today.



   

                   

- We'll get 'em.

- Okay. Okay.

- There you go. Boss.



   

                   

- Here you go.

- Look out on that end.

Look out. Iook out!



   

                   

Come on. Guys. Whoa!



   

                   

Whoa! Look out!

Look out! Look out!



   

                   

Christmas is a very busy time

for us. Mr Cratchit.



   

                   

People preparing feasts.

giving parties...



   

                   

spending the mortgage money

on frivolities.



   

                   

One might say that December

is the foreclosure season.



   

                   

Harvest time for the moneylenders.



   

                   

- Hey. Boss. Ask him.

- Tell him. Mr Cratchit.



   

                   

- Come on. Do it now. Boss.

- Uh. If you please. Mr Scrooge...



   

                   

it's gotten colder.

and the bookkeeping staff...



   

                   

would like to have an extra

shovelful of coal for the fire.



   

                   

- We can't do the bookkeeping.

- Yeah. All of our pens

have turned to ink-cicles.



   

                   

Our assets are frozen!



   

                   

How would the bookkeepers like

to be suddenly unemployed?



   

                   

Heatwave!



   

                   

This is my island in the sun



   

                   

l-I believe you've convinced them

once again. Mr Scrooge.



   

                   

At that moment.

who should arrive at the door...



   

                   

but Scrooge's nephew. Fred.

his only living relative.



   

                   

- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.

- Trust me.



   

                   

Hello? Uncle?



   

                   

- Rizzo?

- You're very good at that. Mr Dickens.



   

                   

A merry Christmas. Uncle Scrooge.



   

                   

- God save ya!

- Merry Christmas? Bah humbug.



   

                   

Quick! It'll be warmer in there.



   

                   

Christmas a humbug. Uncle?

Oh. You don't mean that. Surely.



   

                   

Actually. I think

it's colder in here.



   

                   

Merry Christmas you say?

What right have you to be merry?

You're poor enough.



   

                   

What right have you to be dismal?

You're rich enough.



   

                   

He's got him there.

The old boy's speechless.



   

                   

If I could work my will...



   

                   

every idiot who goes about

with "Merry Christmas" on his lips...



   

                   

would be cooked with his own turkey

and buried...



   

                   

- With a stake of holly through his heart.

- Well. Not quite speechless.



   

                   

- Oh. Uncle!

- Nephew...



   

                   

you keep Christmas in your own way

and let me keep it in mine.



   

                   

Christmas is a loving.

honest and charitable time.



   

                   

And though it's never put a scrap

of gold or silver in my pocket...



   

                   

I believe that Christmas has

done me good and will do me good...



   

                   

and I say. God bless it!



   

                   

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!



   

                   

And how does one celebrate Christmas

on the unemployment line?



   

                   

Now. In these times. It was customary

on Christmas Eve...



   

                   

for well-meaning gentlemen

to call upon businesses...



   

                   

collecting donations

for the poor and homeless.



   

                   

Mr Scrooge. I presume?



   

                   

Who are you?



   

                   

We're from the Order of Victoria

Charity Foundation.



   

                   

We'd like to speak to you

about a donation.



   

                   

Ah. Welcome! This jolly old

gentleman here is Mr Scrooge.



   

                   

- He's very generous to charities.

- My dear nephew!



   

                   

At this festive season

of the year. Mr Scrooge...



   

                   

many of us feel that we must take care

of our poor and homeless.



   

                   

And are there no prisons?

No poorhouses?



   

                   

Oh. Plenty of those. Sir.



   

                   

Oh! Excellent!

For a moment. I was worried.



   

                   

Some of us are endeavouring to raise

a fund for the poor and the homeless.



   

                   

What might I put you down for?



   

                   

- Nothing.

- You wish to remain anonymous?



   

                   

I wish to be left alone.



   

                   

I do not make merry

myself at Christmas.



   

                   

- That certainly is true.

- And I cannot afford

to make idle people merry.



   

                   

That is certainly not true.



   

                   

Don't you have other things to do

this afternoon. My dear nephew?



   

                   

Sadly. I do. Uncle.

So I shall make my donation...



   

                   

and leave you to make yours.



   

                   

Thank you so very much.



   

                   

Oh. Uncle. Come and have Christmas

dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.



   

                   

- Why ever did you get married?

- Why? Because I fell in love.



   

                   

That's the only thing in the world

sillier than a merry Christmas.



   

                   

It's no use. Uncle. I shall keep

my Christmas humour to the last.



   

                   

A merry Christmas to you

and a happy New Year.



   

                   

- Merry Christmas. Fred.

- Merry Christmas. Bob.



   

                   

Humbug!



   

                   

Now. Then. Sir.

about the donation?



   

                   

Well. Now. Let's see.



   

                   

I know how to treat the poor.



   

                   

My taxes go to pay

for the prisons and the poorhouses.



   

                   

- The homeless must go there.

- But some would rather die.



   

                   

If they'd rather die.

then they'd better do it...



   

                   

and decrease the surplus population!



   

                   

Oh. Dear. Oh. Dear.



   

                   

- Oh. Dear. Oh. Dear.

- This is the door. You may use it.



   

                   

All right. Beaker. Come along.



   

                   

I think we've taken enough

of Mr Scrooge's time.



   

                   

Oh. Dear. Dear. Dear.



   

                   

Good King Wenceslas looked out

on the Feast of Stephen



   

                   

Though the snow lay round about

deep and crisp and even



   

                   

Brightly shown

the moon that night



   

                   

Though the



   

                   

- What do you want?

- Uh. P-penny for the song. Guv'nor?



   

                   

Seventeen. Twenty-four. Fifty-eight...



   

                   

two fifty-two. Twenty-one.

seventy-eight.



   

                   

Uh. Excuse me. Mr Scrooge.

but it appears to be closing time.



   

                   

Very well. I'll see you

at  .   tomorrow morning.



   

                   

- Tomorrow's Christmas.

-  .   then.



   

                   

If you please. Sir. Half an hour off hardly

seems customary for Christmas Day.



   

                   

- Hardly customary.

- Not at all!



   

                   

How much time off is customary.

Mr Cratchit?



   

                   

Uh. Why. Um.

the. Uh. Whole day.



   

                   

- Yes! Yeah. That's right! The whole day!

- The entire day?



   

                   

No. That's the frog's idea.



   

                   

If you please. Mr Scrooge.

why open the office tomorrow?



   

                   

Other businesses will be closed.

You'll have no one to do business with.



   

                   

It'll waste a lot

of expensive coal for the fire.



   

                   

- Yes. That's definitely a point.

- That's a point.

- That's right.



   

                   

It's a poor excuse for picking

a man's pocket every December the   th.



   

                   

But as I seem to be the only person

around who knows that...



   

                   

- Take the day off.

- Yay!



   

                   

What a boss! Oh. Man!



   

                   

- We love you. Ebenezer!

- Will you stop that!



   

                   

Thank you. Mr Scrooge.



   

                   

- Be here all the earlier the next morning.

- Okay. Sir! You bet!



   

                   

With their employer gone at last...



   

                   

Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers

immediately began...



   

                   

that most pleasant of activities.

the celebration of Christmas.



   

                   

He's gone!



   

                   

Gentlemen.

let's close up for Christmas.



   

                   

There's magic in the air this evening

Magic in the air



   

                   

The world is at her best

you know



   

                   

When people love and care



   

                   

The promise of excitement



   

                   

Is one the night will keep



   

                   

After all, there's only

one more sleep till Christmas



   

                   

- Okay. Fellas. Are you ready?

- Ready. Go.



   

                   

- Alley-oop!

- Yay!



   

                   

The world has got a smile today



   

                   

The world has got a glow



   

                   

- There's no such thing as strangers

when a stranger says hello

- Alley-oop! Yay!



   

                   

And everyone is family

We're having so much fun



   

                   

After all, there's only

one more sleep till Christmas



   

                   

Okay. Ready.

Here we go.



   

                   

Alley-oop!



   

                   

- Yay!

- Ta-da!



   

                   

- Easy. Easy.

- Back. Back. Back. Back.



   

                   

Back it up.

All right!



   

                   

That's it!



   

                   

- We're all done.

- Very good. Gentlemen.



   

                   

'Tis the season

to bejolly and joyous



   

                   

With a burst of pleasure

we feel it arrive



   

                   

It's a season when the saints

can employ us



   

                   

To spread the news about peace

and to keep love alive



   

                   

What's that?

Oh. Iook!



   

                   

It's the penguins'

Christmas skating party.



   

                   

Oh. My.



   

                   

- Ah! Hmm. Uh. Yeah.

- Hey. What...



   

                   

Hey. It's Bob Cratchit!



   

                   

Oh. You big klutz.

you big klutz!



   

                   

Oh. Thank you.

Thank you very much. What...



   

                   

Wow!



   

                   

- No way!

- Come on. Rizzo.



   

                   

No way! No!



   

                   

Oh. Boy.



   

                   

Fun. Huh?



   

                   

Merry Christmas. Penguins.



   

                   

There's something in the wind today



   

                   

- That's good for everyone

- Yeah.



   

                   

Yes, faith is in our hearts today



   

                   

We're shining like the sun



   

                   

And everyone can feel it



   

                   

- The feeling's running deep

- Merry Christmas. Mr Cratchit.



   

                   

- After all, there's only

one more sleep till Christmas

- Merry Christmas!



   

                   

After all

there's only one more sleep



   

                   

Till Christmas Day



   

                   

- Merry Christmas!

- Hmm.



   

                   

Wow.



   

                   

Scrooge lived in chambers

which had once belonged...



   

                   

to his old business partners.

Jacob and Robert Marley.



   

                   

- Have some bread?

- Not while I'm working.



   

                   

- Whoa. Whoa.

- Okay. Suit yourself.



   

                   

The building was a dismal

heap of brick on a dark street.



   

                   

Now. Once again. I must ask you to

remember that the Marleys were dead...



   

                   

- And decaying in their graves.

- Yuck!



   

                   

That one thing

you must remember...



   

                   

or nothing that follows

will seem wondrous.



   

                   

- Um. Why are you whispering?

- It's for dramatic emphasis.



   

                   

Oh.



   

                   

Jacob Marley?



   

                   

Scrooge!



   

                   

Hey. You okay?



   

                   

Humbug.



   

                   

Oh. Gonzo. Speak to me.



   

                   

I mean. Mr Dickens.

Charley. Are you hurt?



   

                   

To say that Scrooge

was not startled would be untrue.



   

                   

Still. The moment had passed.

and the world was as it should be.



   

                   

He ain't hurt.

Didn't even break his concentration.



   

                   

- Hmm?

- Nothin'.

- Oh.



   

                   

Come on. Rizzo.

We'll follow him in.



   

                   

In a minute. I had a little bag

of jelly beans over here.



   

                   

Will you just get over here!



   

                   

- All right.

- Sheesh.



   

                   

- Steady. Steady.

- Scrooge made his way up the staircase...



   

                   

caring not a button for the darkness.



   

                   

Darkness was cheap.

and Scrooge liked it.



   

                   

But the incident at the door

had made Scrooge wary.



   

                   

Before he shut himself in for the night.

he searched his rooms.



   

                   

- Okay. That does it!

- Pardon?



   

                   

How do you know

what Scrooge is doin'?



   

                   

- We're down here. And he's up there.

- I keep telling you.



   

                   

Storytellers are omniscient.

I know everything.



   

                   

Hoity-toity.

Mr Godlike Smarty-pants.



   

                   

To conduct a proper search.

Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.



   

                   

How does he do that?



   

                   

It's my best dressing gown.



   

                   

No harm done.



   

                   

Look! It's Ebenezer Scrooge.



   

                   

Looking older and

more wicked than ever.



   

                   

I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.



   

                   

Who are you?



   

                   

In life.

we were your partners. Jacob...



   

                   

And Robert Marley!



   

                   

It looks like you.

but I don't believe it!



   

                   

Why do you doubt your senses?



   

                   

Because a little thing

can affect them.



   

                   

A slight disorder of the stomach

can make them cheat.



   

                   

You may be a bit

of undigested beef...



   

                   

a blob of mustard.

a crumb of cheese.



   

                   

Yes. There's more of gravy

than of grave about you!



   

                   

- "More of gravy than of grave"?

- What a terrible pun.



   

                   

- Where do you get those jokes?

- Leave comedy to the bears. Ebenezer.



   

                   

Please. Jacob. Robert.

don't criticize me.



   

                   

You always criticize me!



   

                   

- We were always heckling you.

- It's good to be heckling again.



   

                   

It's good to be doing anything again.



   

                   

Why do you come to me?



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

Avarice and greed



   

                   

We took advantage of the poor

Just ignored the needy



   

                   

We specialized in causing pain



   

                   

Spreading fear and doubt



   

                   

And if you could not pay the rent



   

                   

We simply threw you out



   

                   

There was the year we evicted

the entire orphanage!



   

                   

I remember the little tykes

all standing in the snowbank.



   

                   

With their little

frostbitten teddy bears.



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

Our hearts were painted black



   

                   

We should've known our evil deeds



   

                   

Would put us both in shackles



   

                   

Captive bound

we're double-ironed



   

                   

Exhausted by the weight



   

                   

- As freedom comes from giving love

- So prison comes with hate



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

But. My friends. You were not

unfeeling toward your fellow men.



   

                   

True. There was something

about mankind we loved.



   

                   

I think it was their money.



   

                   

Doomed, Scrooge

You're doomed for all time



   

                   

Your future is a horror story

written by your crime



   

                   

Your chains are forged

by what you say and do



   

                   

So have your fun when life is done

A nightmare waits for you



   

                   

What are these terrible chains?



   

                   

Oh. The chains!



   

                   

We forged these chains in life

by our acts of greed.



   

                   

You wear such a chain yourself.



   

                   

Humbug.

Speak comfort to me. Friends.



   

                   

Comfort?



   

                   

You will be haunted

by three spirits.



   

                   

Haunted?

I've already had enough of that.



   

                   

Without these visits. You cannot hope

to avoid the path we tread.



   

                   

Expect the first ghost tonight

when the bell tolls  .  .



   

                   

Can't I meet them all at once

and get it over with?



   

                   

When the bell tolls  .  !



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

We're Marley and Marley



   

                   

Change!



   

                   

And with that. The spirits of Scrooge's

partners vanished into the darkness...



   

                   

leaving him once again...



   

                   

- Alone in his room.

- Whoa. That's scary stuff.



   

                   

Hey. Should we be worried

about the kids in the audience?



   

                   

- Nah. That's all right. This is culture.

- Oh.



   

                   

Oh. Uh. Jelly bean?

I had 'em in my pocket all along.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Humbug.



   

                   

- Come on!

- But I really hate this.



   

                   

You wanted to know

what was happening.



   

                   

Now. Scrooge's bedchamber is

on this side of the house. Now. Jump.



   

                   

There's only two things in this life

I hate... heights and jumping from them.



   

                   

Too late now.

Come on. I'll catch ya.



   

                   

God save my little broken body.



   

                   

Missed.



   

                   

Oh. Wait a second!

I forgot my jelly beans. Um...



   

                   

Oh. Good.



   

                   

- What?

- You can fit through those bars?



   

                   

Yeah.



   

                   

- You are such an idiot.

- What? What?



   

                   

Hey. What?

What? What?



   

                   

Oh. Dear.



   

                   

Scrooge slipped into the empty silence

of a dreamless sleep.



   

                   

You know. A guy could break his tail

falling out of this tree.



   

                   

You want to see

what's going on. Don't you?



   

                   

- Yes.

- Look. There's Scrooge's window.



   

                   

Oh. Yeah.



   

                   

Expect the first ghost

when the bell tolls  .  !



   

                   

Wow!



   

                   

Are you the spirit whose coming

was foretold to me?



   

                   

I am.



   

                   

But...



   

                   

- You're just a child.

- I can remember nearly  .    years.



   

                   

I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.



   

                   

- What business has brought you here?

- Your welfare.



   

                   

A night's unbroken rest

might aid my welfare.



   

                   

Your salvation then.



   

                   

Take heed.

Come.



   

                   

I beg you. Spirit.

l... I am mortal and liable to fall.



   

                   

A touch of my hand

and you shall fly.



   

                   

- What are we doin'?

- Nothin'.



   

                   

- What?

- Well. Just hold on.

- What?



   

                   

- W-Watch out. Rizzo.

- What? Ow! Oh!



   

                   

Whee!

Hello. London!



   

                   

- Goodbye. Lunch!

- Yeah!



   

                   

- Spirit?

- Yes?



   

                   

Nothing.



   

                   

- Oh. Iook. Rizzo.

- I don't wanna look.



   

                   

Spirit. What is that light?



   

                   

It cannot be dawn.



   

                   

It is the past.



   

                   

Look! It's beautiful. Rizzo.



   

                   

Mommy!



   

                   

Hey. We're going down.



   

                   

Hang on. Rizzo!



   

                   

- Sorry. Madam.

- Ouch!



   

                   

Pardon me. Sir.

Look out. Rizzo!



   

                   

- Rizzo. This is Louise.

- Yeah. We've met.



   

                   

And so they arrived

in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.



   

                   

- That was the worst trip of my life!

- Well. It's over now.



   

                   

Yeah. Safe at last.



   

                   

No.



   

                   

No! No!

Oh. No. Stop.



   

                   

Nice kitty. Nice kitty.

Ow! Ouch! I'm from New Jersey!



   

                   

It was the afternoon

of Christmas Eve...



   

                   

and Scrooge was conscious

of a thousand odours...



   

                   

each one connected

with a thousand thoughts...



   

                   

and hopes and joys and cares...



   

                   

long. Long forgotten.



   

                   

It's my old school.

I was a boy here.



   

                   

That... That's Henry!



   

                   

And Edmund. My best friend.



   

                   

Hello. Boys.

Hello?



   

                   

These are but shadows

of your past. Ebenezer.



   

                   

They can neither see nor hear you.



   

                   

Come and let us go inside.



   

                   

- Rizzo. Stop playing with the cat.

- Help me! Save me!



   

                   

- Help me! Save me! Help me! Save me!

- Follow me.



   

                   

Help me! Save me!



   

                   

Ow.



   

                   

And what a flood of memories

came back to him...



   

                   

as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.



   

                   

I know it all so well. Spirit.



   

                   

The desks.



   

                   

The smell of the chalk.



   

                   

I chose my profession in this room.



   

                   

And is he. Too. Familiar?



   

                   

Scrooge beheld a small boy...



   

                   

a boy he knew.

oh. Very well indeed.



   

                   

Good heavens.

It's me.



   

                   

Hurry. Ebenezer.

The last coach is leaving.



   

                   

Come on.

He never goes home for Christmas.



   

                   

Who cares about stupid old Christmas?



   

                   

I was often alone.



   

                   

More time for reading and study.



   

                   

The Christmas holiday was a chance

to get some extra work done.



   

                   

A time for solitude.



   

                   

- Rats don't understand these things.

- You were never a lonely child?



   

                   

I had  .     brothers and sisters.



   

                   

Sheesh.

Rats don't understand these things.



   

                   

Let us see another Christmas

in this place.



   

                   

They were all very much the same.



   

                   

- Nothing ever changed.

- You changed.



   

                   

The years performed

their terrible dance...



   

                   

and in a moment. Scrooge had seen

his entire childhood pass.



   

                   

He saw his old schoolroom

age and decay.



   

                   

What? What the...

Hey. Hey! Ow!



   

                   

So. Master Scrooge.

graduation day. And yet...



   

                   

That's my old headmaster.

This man taught me my greatest lesson.



   

                   

Stand up. Build your life

as this school is built.



   

                   

Push!



   

                   

My ear! My ear! My ear!



   

                   

Ah. Yes! Work hard. Work long

and be constructive.



   

                   

Oh. Ebenezer.

life is a golden opportunity.



   

                   

Today you go forth

into the real world.



   

                   

You must keep your nose

to the grindstone.



   

                   

Work hard. Lad. And one day

your life will be as solid...



   

                   

as this very building!



   

                   

- I've been meaning to fix that shelf.

- Yes. Headmaster.



   

                   

Well. Young man. You have been

apprenticed to a fine company in London.



   

                   

Today you become a man of business.



   

                   

- I'm looking forward to it. Headmaster.

- You will love business.



   

                   

It is the American way.



   

                   

- Sam?

- Hmm?



   

                   

Oh. It is the British way!



   

                   

- Good.

- Yes. Headmaster.



   

                   

Oh. Here is your coachman. Ebenezer.



   

                   

Come. Scrooge.

There is much to see.



   

                   

Remember. Don't tip the driver.



   

                   

A moment later. Scrooge found himself

standing on a city street...



   

                   

Iooking at a building

he had not seen in years.



   

                   

Tell me. Ebenezer Scrooge.

do you know this place?



   

                   

Know it?

My first job was here.



   

                   

This is Fozziwig's

old rubber chicken factory.



   

                   

Once again.

it was Christmas Eve.



   

                   

Night was falling. And the lamplighters

were plying their trade.



   

                   

H-Hey! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!

Light the lamp. Not the rat!



   

                   

- Light the lamp. Not the rat!

What are you doing?

- Oops! My apologies.



   

                   

Put me out! Put me out! Put me out!

Put me out! Put me out! Put me out!



   

                   

- Rizzo!

- What?



   

                   

- Th-Th-Thank you.

- You're welcome.



   

                   

There he is.

old Fozziwig himself.



   

                   

Look. My lads.

dusk has fallen.



   

                   

The lamplighters are at work.

It's Christmas Eve for certain.



   

                   

What an employer he was.



   

                   

As hard and as ruthless

as a rose petal.



   

                   

It's time for the party to begin!



   

                   

It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.



   

                   

Rizzo. Come on!



   

                   

Rizzo. Just grab hold of the stick.



   

                   

Merry Christmas!



   

                   

- Merry Christmas.

- Thank you. Thank you.



   

                   

Excuse me. Everyone.

C-Can we have some quiet. Please?



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

I suppose I should

be grateful for that.



   

                   

You're welcome.



   

                   

Please. Can I have your attention

for a moment?



   

                   

Look. It's the Marley brothers...



   

                   

my old partners as they were as lads.



   

                   

Can I have your attention. Please?



   

                   

Quiet!



   

                   

- Thank you.

- That's better.



   

                   

Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's

annual Christmas party.



   

                   

At this time in the proceedings.

it is a tradition for me

to make a little speech.



   

                   

And it's a tradition for us

to take a little nap.



   

                   

Pay no attention to them.

My speech.



   

                   

Here is my Christmas speech.



   

                   

"Thank you all.

and Merry Christmas."



   

                   

- That was the speech?

- It was dumb!



   

                   

- It was obvious!

- It was pointless!



   

                   

It was short.



   

                   

- I loved it!

- I loved it!



   

                   

I'm bored with speeches.

Let's dance. Son.



   

                   

Hey. Here's Mrs Fozziwig

to start the party.



   

                   

- Way to go. Ma!

- Hit it. Boys!



   

                   

Hello!



   

                   

Hey. Iook. There's a buffet over here.

I'm kinda hungry.



   

                   

In this ferdy hurdy bursky



   

                   

Fa la la la la

la la la la



   

                   

Ah. Forget it.

Mother always taught me...



   

                   

never eat singing food.



   

                   

It's a pleasure having you

here at the party.



   

                   

- Please. Enjoy yourself.

- Excuse me. Mr Fozziwig?



   

                   

- Excuse me.

- Yes. I've been going over the accounts.



   

                   

Do you know how much the firm

is spending for this party?



   

                   

Master Scrooge. This is Christmas!

It's a time for generosity!



   

                   

Stop working. Enjoy yourself.

Go meet some people.



   

                   

Go ahead. Go ahead.

Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh. Hello.



   

                   

You dancing fool!



   

                   

Belle. You know. I love these

annual Christmas parties.



   

                   

I love 'em so much.

I think we'll do it twice a year!



   

                   

- Excuse me.

- Oh. Master Scrooge!



   

                   

Excuse me.



   

                   

Belle. I'd like to introduce you

to Ebenezer Scrooge...



   

                   

the finest young

financial mind in the city.



   

                   

Ebenezer. This is Belle.

a friend of the Fozziwig family.



   

                   

I'm pleased to meet you.



   

                   

Well. I'm glad you two finally met.



   

                   

Do you remember this meeting?



   

                   

Remember?



   

                   

Yes.



   

                   

I remember.



   

                   

There was. Of course.

another Christmas Eve...



   

                   

with this young woman

some years later.



   

                   

Oh. Please...



   

                   

do not show me that Christmas.



   

                   

Another year

before our wedding. Ebenezer.



   

                   

Well. It can't be helped. Belle.



   

                   

How could we marry now? There's not

even enough for a decent home.



   

                   

The investments

haven't grown as they should.



   

                   

So you said last year.



   

                   

Business continues to be poor.



   

                   

You're a partner in your own firm now.



   

                   

And barely clearing expenses.



   

                   

- You said the partnership was the goal.

- This is for you.



   

                   

I love you. Belle.



   

                   

You did once.



   

                   

Oh. Rizzo.



   

                   

Spirit. Show me no more.



   

                   

Why do you delight

in torturing me?



   

                   

I told you. These were the shadows

of the things that have been.



   

                   

That they are what they are.

do not blame me.



   

                   

Leave me!



   

                   

Scrooge was left alone and exhausted

in his bedchamber.



   

                   

And thus he remained until the nearby

clock began to strike the hour.



   

                   

- What was that?

-  .  .



   

                   

- Oh. Is it too early for breakfast?

- Yes.



   

                   

Oh. Good.

Supper time.



   

                   

Scrooge knew that the second

of the ghosts was due to appear.



   

                   

Yet now. As the clock

finished striking...



   

                   

Nothing.



   

                   

Come in and know me better. Man.



   

                   

Come in and know me better. Man.



   

                   

- Did I already say that?

- You did. Yeah.



   

                   

I am the Ghost

of Christmas Present.



   

                   

This is the night before the dawn

before the day of Christmas!



   

                   

Did I tell you that I am

the Ghost of Christmas Present?



   

                   

- You did. Yeah.

- Come in and know me better. Man!



   

                   

You're a little absentminded. Spirit.



   

                   

No! I'm a large

absentminded spirit!



   

                   

My mind is filled

with the here and now.



   

                   

And the now is Christmas!



   

                   

I don't believe I've ever met

anybody like you before. Sir.



   

                   

Really? Over  .    of my brothers

have come before me.



   

                   

 .   ?



   

                   

Imagine the grocery bills.



   

                   

Have you ever noticed that everything

seems wonderful at Christmas?



   

                   

In all honesty. Spirit. No.



   

                   

Perhaps I've never understood

about Christmas.



   

                   

Before this day is done.

you will understand!



   

                   

Oh. No. Oh. No!



   

                   

Ah. We shall go out into the world.



   

                   

I suppose you enjoyed that.



   

                   

Of course.



   

                   

May I welcome you

to Christmas morning.



   

                   

It's in the singing

of a street corner choir



   

                   

It's going home

and getting warm by the fire



   

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

A cup of kindness

that we share with another



   

                   

A sweet reunion

with a friend or a brother



   

                   

In all the places you find love



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

It is the season of the heart



   

                   

A special time of caring



   

                   

The ways of love made clear



   

                   

And it is

the season of the spirit



   

                   

The message, if we hear it



   

                   

Is make it last all year



   

                   

It's in the giving

of a gift to another



   

                   

A pair of mittens

that were made by your mother



   

                   

It's all the ways

that we show love



   

                   

That feel like Christmas



   

                   

A part of childhood

we'll always remember



   

                   

It is the summer

of the soul in December



   

                   

Yes, when you do

your best for love



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

It is the season of the heart



   

                   

A special time of caring



   

                   

The ways of love made clear



   

                   

It is the season of the spirit



   

                   

The message, if we hear it



   

                   

Is make it last all year



   

                   

It's in the singing

of a street corner choir



   

                   

It's going home

and getting warm by the fire



   

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



   

                   

It feels like



   

                   

Christmas



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

It feels like Christmas



   

                   

Spirit. I had no idea.



   

                   

I wish to see friends. Kin.

Show me family.



   

                   

It's... It's Fred.



   

                   

My dear nephew Fred and his wife Clara

having Christmas with friends.



   

                   

- Hey. Iook! Fruit!

- Well. There now!



   

                   

We've had the plum pudding and sung

the carols.



   

                   

- What now. My lovelies?

- A game. Fred.



   

                   

Yeah. We must have

a game at Christmas.



   

                   

- Do people play games at Christmas?

- I love games!



   

                   

Say. Do you know

that fruit is wax?



   

                   

Oh. Yeah.

I wondered about the texture.



   

                   

- Let's play "Yes and No."

- A wonderful game!



   

                   

- Oh. Yes!

- Ah! That's a great game! I'll be it.



   

                   

Yes. Let Fred be it.

He always thinks of good things.



   

                   

I do have a good one. Clara.

Guess!



   

                   

- Is it vegetable?

- No.



   

                   

- Mineral?

- No.



   

                   

- Animal. Then?

- What else?

- What else. Indeed!



   

                   

- Is it found on a farm?

- Never.



   

                   

- In the city?

- Usually.



   

                   

- Does it pull a hansom cab?

- Certainly not!



   

                   

How about a dog?



   

                   

- No.

- A cat?



   

                   

- A cat?

- I said it first.



   

                   

No.



   

                   

Wait. Then.

Is this an unwanted creature?



   

                   

- Often.

- A mouse.



   

                   

- No.

- A rat.



   

                   

- You called?

- A cockroach.



   

                   

- No.

- A leech.



   

                   

- Oh. Dear. It's too wonderful.

- Wait! Wait! I know!



   

                   

An unwanted creature.

but not a rat. A leech or cockroach.



   

                   

- Then what?

- Then what?

- What?



   

                   

- It's Ebenezer Scrooge!

- Yes!



   

                   

Wonderful!



   

                   

- Yes!

- That's a good one!

- That's a killer!



   

                   

Come.

There's much to see.



   

                   

No more.

I wish to see no more.



   

                   

Here.



   

                   

Why have we come to

this odd corner of the town?



   

                   

It's Christmas here. Too. You know.



   

                   

That's Bob Cratchit's house.



   

                   

Perhaps it was the spirit's

own generous nature...



   

                   

and his sympathy

for all poor men...



   

                   

that led them straight to the home

of Scrooge's faithful clerk.



   

                   

Goose!

They're cookin' goose down there!



   

                   

- Rizzo. Get out of the way!

- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!



   

                   

Don't be sweeping the chimney now.

You're blockin' the smell!



   

                   

This is Bob Cratchit's house?



   

                   

- How do you know that?

- You just told me.



   

                   

Well. I'm usually trustworthy.



   

                   

- Who's that?

- Mrs Cratchit. Of course!



   

                   

Peter. Do not stop turning that spit.



   

                   

That is the whole secret

of a properly roasted goose.



   

                   

It smells so good. Mother.



   

                   

It does. Doesn't it?



   

                   

Oh. That smells wonderful!



   

                   

Oh. Good grief!



   

                   

Hey. I'm stuck.

Get me outta here.



   

                   

I knew you weren't

suited for literature.



   

                   

At least I landed

on something soft.



   

                   

And hot!

Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!



   

                   

Mother. Mother. Mother! I thought

you said we couldn't eat the chestnuts...



   

                   

until Father and Tiny Tim get home.



   

                   

l-l-I wasn't eating them.



   

                   

I was... I was merely checking them

to see if they were not burnt.



   

                   

It's a chef's thing. Dear.

And do not shout. Betina.



   

                   

- I'm Belinda!

- I'm Betina!



   

                   

Of course you are. Betina.



   

                   

- Belinda!

- Whatever.



   

                   

- Hmmph!

- Hmmph!



   

                   

'Tis the season

to bejolly and joyous



   

                   

Fa la la



   

                   

With a burst of pleasure

we feel it arrive



   

                   

Fa la la



   

                   

It's a season when

the saints can employ us



   

                   

Fa la la



   

                   

To spread the news about peace

and to keep love alive



   

                   

- Come on. Son.

- Yeah.



   

                   

Let's go see

if Christmas dinner is ready yet.



   

                   

- Oh. Yeah.

- Yes.



   

                   

Careful.



   

                   

Merry Christmas. Everyone.



   

                   

Daddy!



   

                   

Merry Christmas. Girls.

Merry Christmas. Peter.



   

                   

- Merry Christmas.

- Children. Children. Children!



   

                   

Now... Now it's time to set the table.

Go ahead.



   

                   

Wait for me!



   

                   

- Merry Christmas. Emily.

- Merry Christmas. Cratchie.



   

                   

- Emmie!

- Hmm?



   

                   

I fell down the chimney and landed

on a flaming hot goose.



   

                   

You have all the fun.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Oh. Peter!

The Christmas dinner!



   

                   

The goose!

The goose!



   

                   

Oh. No. No. Now. Son. Son.

now you've gotten too excited.



   

                   

You go sit in your chair a moment.

Okay. Rest. Rest a moment.



   

                   

- How was he at church?

- As good as gold and better.



   

                   

He told me that he hoped the people

saw him in church because...



   

                   

it might be pleasant for them

to remember upon Christmas Day...



   

                   

who made lame beggars walk

and blind men see.



   

                   

A remarkable child!



   

                   

And with that. The Cratchits

came to what was surely...



   

                   

the happiest single moment

in all the livelong year.



   

                   

- Such a meagre feast.

- But very much appreciated.



   

                   

I pay Bob such a small amount.



   

                   

- Mr Scrooge!

- Bob!



   

                   

Bob Cratchit!



   

                   

It only seems right that I should

lift a glass to my employer.



   

                   

I give you Mr Scrooge.

the founder of the feast.



   

                   

- The founder of the feast. Indeed!

- Hmmph!



   

                   

If I had him here. I would give him

a piece of my mind to feast upon.



   

                   

And I bet he would

choke on it. Hmm!



   

                   

- Choke!

- Choke!

- My dear!



   

                   

The... The children!

Christmas Day!



   

                   

Well. I suppose that

on the blessed day of Christmas...



   

                   

one must drink to the health

of. Uh. Mr Scrooge.



   

                   

- Even though he is odious. Stingy...

- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.



   

                   

- Wicked and unfeeling...

- Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!



   

                   

and badly dressed...



   

                   

- And...

- To the founder of the feast. Mr Scrooge!



   

                   

To Mr Scrooge.



   

                   

He'll be very merry and happy

this day. I have no doubt.



   

                   

- No doubt.

- Cheers!



   

                   

God bless us. Every one!



   

                   

Life is full of sweet surprises



   

                   

Every day's a gift



   

                   

The sun comes up

and I can feel it



   

                   

Lift my spirit



   

                   

Fills me up with laughter



   

                   

Fills me up with song



   

                   

I look into the eyes of love



   

                   

And know that I belong



   

                   

Bless us all



   

                   

Who gather here



   

                   

The loving family I hold dear



   

                   

No place on earth



   

                   

Compares with home



   

                   

And every path will bring me back

from where I roam



   

                   

Bless us all



   

                   

That as we live



   

                   

We always comfort and forgive



   

                   

We have so much



   

                   

That we can share



   

                   

With those in need

we see around us everywhere



   

                   

Let us always love each other



   

                   

Lead us to the light



   

                   

Let us hear the voice of reason



   

                   

Singing in the night



   

                   

Let us run from anger



   

                   

And catch us when we fall



   

                   

Teach us in our dreams



   

                   

And please, yes, please



   

                   

Bless us one and all



   

                   

Bless us all



   

                   

With playful years



   

                   

With noisy games and joyful tears



   

                   

We reach for you



   

                   

And we stand tall



   

                   

And in our prayers and dreams

we ask you bless us all



   

                   

We reach for you



   

                   

And we stand tall



   

                   

And in our prayers and dreams



   

                   

We ask you bless us all



   

                   

Let's all take our seats now.

Let's have dinner.



   

                   

Spirit. Tell me if

Tiny Tim will live.



   

                   

That is the future.



   

                   

My realm is the present.



   

                   

However. Ah. I see a vacant seat

by the chimney corner...



   

                   

and a crutch

without an owner.



   

                   

If these shadows

remain unaltered...



   

                   

I believe the child will die.



   

                   

What then? If he's going to die.

he had better do it...



   

                   

and decrease

the surplus population.



   

                   

Oh. Spirit.



   

                   

As the Cratchit family

vanished into the darkness...



   

                   

Scrooge kept his eyes

upon Tiny Tim until the last.



   

                   

Come. My time grows short.



   

                   

- Spirit. Do you grow old?

- I do.



   

                   

Are spirits' lives so short?



   

                   

My time upon this globe is very brief.



   

                   

I believe it will end

upon the stroke of   .  .



   

                   

Uh! One.



   

                   

Now? But. Spirit. I have

learned so much from you.



   

                   

- Three.

- Nothing Scrooge could do or say

could stop the relentless march...

- Four.



   

                   

- Of those terrible bells.

- Five.



   

                   

Oh. Spirit. Do not leave me.



   

                   

I think I must. In fact.



   

                   

You have meant so much to me.

You have changed me.



   

                   

And now I leave you with the Ghost

of Christmas Yet to Come.



   

                   

You mean the future?



   

                   

- Must I?

- Go forth and know him better. Man!



   

                   

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!



   

                   

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!



   

                   

Am I in the presence...



   

                   

of the Ghost of Christmas

Yet to Come?



   

                   

Spirit. I fear you more...



   

                   

than any spectre I have yet met.



   

                   

Oh. This is too scary. I don't think

I want to see any more.



   

                   

Oh. When you're right.

you're right.



   

                   

You're on your own. Folks.

We'll meet you at the finale.



   

                   

- Yeah. Oh!

- Ah!



   

                   

I am prepared to follow

and to learn...



   

                   

with a thankful heart.



   

                   

Will you not speak to me?



   

                   

Oh. Yes. Yes.

The night is waning fast.



   

                   

Lead on. Spirit.



   

                   

No. I don't know much about it

either way.



   

                   

I only know he's dead.



   

                   

- Yeah.

- When?

- Last night. I believe.



   

                   

- Hmm. Wonder what he died of.

- Mm!



   

                   

I thought he'd never go.



   

                   

Well. I don't know or care

why he's gone.



   

                   

I'd just like to know what

he's done with his money.



   

                   

- That's right!

- Wouldn't we all?

- Well. He didn't give it to me.



   

                   

- No. No.

- No!

- Well. It's likely to be a cheap funeral.



   

                   

I don't know a single soul

who'd go to it.



   

                   

- I wouldn't mind goin'.

- Hey?

- What?



   

                   

If lunch is provided.



   

                   

- I say!

- Speaking of lunch...



   

                   

Oh. Good Lord.

Look at the time.



   

                   

Yes. We must be off.



   

                   

I know some of those gentlemen. Spirit.

Of what poor wretch do they speak?



   

                   

So. Back from the house

of sadness. I see.



   

                   

Huh! Sad that he didn't die years ago.

the old skinflint.



   

                   

- Hear. Hear!

- Well. Let me see.



   

                   

What do you got

for old Joe. Eh?



   

                   

What do you got for me

to remember him by?



   

                   

Joe. Get off!



   

                   

Well. I got these collar buttons

from his dresser.



   

                   

- Mother-of-pearl.

- No. No. No. No.



   

                   

I got his bed curtains.



   

                   

- Very fine damask.

- Oh.



   

                   

Very cheap damask.

but worth a few coins.



   

                   

- Now. I've got his blankets.

- Oh. His blankets?



   

                   

Why. Mrs Dilber.

they're still warm.



   

                   

I don't pay extra

for the warmth. You know.



   

                   

You should.

It's the only warmth he ever had.



   

                   

Only warmth he ever had!



   

                   

The only warmth

he ever had.



   

                   

I understand. Spirit.



   

                   

The case of this unhappy man

might be my own.



   

                   

My-My life tends that way now.



   

                   

Merciful heavens.



   

                   

Let me see some tenderness

connected with this world...



   

                   

or I'll be haunted by that

terrible conversation forever.



   

                   

It's Bob Cratchit's house.



   

                   

Oh. Yes. Spirit.



   

                   

A place of joy and laughter.



   

                   

Thank you

for bringing me here.



   

                   

It's so quiet.



   

                   

Why is it so quiet. Spirit?



   

                   

Oh. Mother. You're crying again.



   

                   

Oh. Um. No. It's just the lamplight

that hurts my eyes.



   

                   

Oh.



   

                   

Not Tiny Tim!



   

                   

Th-There. There now.



   

                   

My eyes get weak

in the... in the dim light.



   

                   

I would not want to show

weak eyes to your father...



   

                   

when he gets home

for anything in the world.



   

                   

He... He should be back now.



   

                   

I think he's walked a little slower

these past two evenings.



   

                   

- Hello. My dears.

- D-Daddy.

- Oh.



   

                   

- Hello. Girls. Hello. Peter.

- Hello.



   

                   

Children. Please...

please go set the table.



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

- How was the churchyard?

- Oh. It'll be lovely. Emily.



   

                   

It would have done you good

to see how green the place is.



   

                   

l... I picked a spot for Tim

where he can see...



   

                   

It-It's a spot on the hill...



   

                   

and you can see

the ducks on the river.



   

                   

- Tiny Tim...

- Tiny Tim always loved...



   

                   

watching the ducks

on the river.



   

                   

Oh. Spirit. Must there

be a Christmas...



   

                   

that brings this awful scene?



   

                   

How can they endure it?



   

                   

It's all right. Children.



   

                   

Life is made up of meetings and partings.

That is the way of it.



   

                   

I am sure we shall never forget

Tiny Tim...



   

                   

or this first parting

that there was among us.



   

                   

Must we return

to this place?



   

                   

There's something else

that I must know...



   

                   

is that not true?



   

                   

Spirit. I know

what I must ask.



   

                   

I fear to. But I must.



   

                   

Who was the wretched man

whose death brought so much...



   

                   

glee and happiness to others?



   

                   

Answer me one more question.



   

                   

Are these the shadows

of things that will be...



   

                   

or are they the shadows

of things that may be only?



   

                   

These events can be changed.



   

                   

A life can be made right.



   

                   

"Ebenezer Scrooge."



   

                   

Oh. Please. Spirit. No.



   

                   

Hear me.

I'm not the man I was.



   

                   

Why would you show me this

if I was past all hope?



   

                   

l... I will honour Christmas

and try to keep it all the year.



   

                   

I will live my life in the past.

the present and the future.



   

                   

I will not shut out the lessons

the spirits have taught me.



   

                   

Tell me that I may sponge out

the writing on this stone.



   

                   

Oh. Spirit. Please speak to me.



   

                   

I'm home.



   

                   

Yes. The bedposts were his own.



   

                   

The bed was his own.

The room was his own.



   

                   

- Hi. Guys! We're back.

- We promised we would be.

- Mm-hmm.



   

                   

But the thing that made Scrooge

happiest of all...



   

                   

was that his life lay before him

and it could be changed.



   

                   

I will live my life in the past.

the present and the future.



   

                   

Oh. Jacob and Robert Marley...



   

                   

Oh. Heaven and the Christmas time

be praised for this day.



   

                   

I say it on my knees. Jacob and Robert.

On my knees.



   

                   

Oh. They're not torn down.

They're here.



   

                   

And I'm here.

More is the miracle.



   

                   

Oh! Oh.



   

                   

I don't know what to do.

l-I'm as light as a feather.



   

                   

I'm as happy as an angel.

I'm... I'm as merry as a schoolboy.



   

                   

Um. Do you think it's safe

for us to be up here?



    

                   

- Scrooge is saved.

What can happen now?

- Yeah.



    

                   

- You there. Boy.

- What. Me?



    

                   

Uh. That is. What. Me. Sir?



    

                   

- What's today?

- Pardon?



    

                   

What's today. My fine fellow?



    

                   

Today? Well. Today

is Christmas Day.



    

                   

It's Christmas Day?

I haven't missed it.



    

                   

The spirits did it all in one night.

They can do anything they like.



    

                   

- Of course they can.

Of course they can.

- Uh. Of course they can.



    

                   

- Do you know the poultry shop

in the next street?

- Yes. Sir. I do.



    

                   

An intelligent lad.

A remarkable lad.



    

                   

Do you know whether the prize turkey

has been sold in the window?



    

                   

Oh. The one twice as big as me?

It's still there.



    

                   

Oh. It's a pleasure

talking with you. Lad.



    

                   

- Go and buy it.

- Be serious.



    

                   

I am being serious. Buy it for me.

and I'll give you a shilling.



    

                   

- Oh!

- No. I'll give you five shillings.

- What?



    

                   

- Wow!

- And so the boy was off like a shot.



    

                   

- So eager...

- Wah!



    

                   

Um. Sorry.



    

                   

I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

What a surprise it'll be.



    

                   

It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.



    

                   

And a few moments later.

dressed in his finest...



    

                   

Scrooge appeared

on the streets of the city...



    

                   

to wish "Merry Christmas"

to all the world.



    

                   

- Merry Christmas.

- Merry Christmas.



    

                   

- Merry Christmas.

- Merry Christmas.



    

                   

Merry Christmas.

Merry Christmas.



    

                   

Gee. Thanks.



    

                   

Everyone was out and about

this fine morning...



    

                   

and soon he encountered

two familiar faces.



    

                   

M-M-Mr Scrooge?



    

                   

Pardon me. Gentlemen. But about

the charity donation...



    

                   

- You asked me for yesterday.

- Oh. Yes?



    

                   

Put me down for...



    

                   

- That much?

- Not a penny less.



    

                   

A great many back payments

are included in it. I assure you.



    

                   

Oh. My goodness.

I don't know what to say.



    

                   

I just wish there was something

we could give you.



    

                   

A gift?



    

                   

A gift for me?



    

                   

Thank you.



    

                   

Thank you...    times.



    

                   

And a Merry Christmas.



    

                   

- Here's your turkey. Mr Scrooge.

- Follow me. Lad.



    

                   

With a thankful heart

With an endless joy



    

                   

With a growing family

Every girl and boy



    

                   

Will be nephew

and niece to me



    

                   

Nephew and niece to me



    

                   

Will bring love, hope

and peace to me



    

                   

Love, hope

and peace to me



    

                   

Yes, and every night will end

and every day will start



    

                   

With a grateful prayer

and a thankful heart



    

                   

With an open smile

and with open doors



    

                   

I will bid you welcome

What is mine is yours



    

                   

With a glass raised

to toast your health



    

                   

With a glass raised

to toast your health



    

                   

And a promise

to share the wealth



    

                   

A promise to share the wealth



    

                   

I will sail a friendly course



    

                   

File a friendly chart



    

                   

- On a sea of love and a thankful heart

- On a sea of love and a thankful heart



    

                   

Life is like a journey



    

                   

Who knows when it ends



    

                   

Yes, and if you need to know



    

                   

The measure of a man



    

                   

You simply count his friends



    

                   

Stop and look around you



    

                   

The glory that you see



    

                   

Is born again each day



    

                   

Don't let it slip away



    

                   

How precious life can be



    

                   

With a thankful heart

that is wide awake



    

                   

I do make this promise

Every breath I take



    

                   

Will be used now

to sing your praise



    

                   

Used now to sing your praise



    

                   

And to beg you

to share my days



    

                   

Beg you to share my days



    

                   

With a loving guarantee



    

                   

That even if we part



    

                   

- I will hold you close in a thankful heart

- I will hold you close in a thankful heart



    

                   

I will hold you close



    

                   

In a thankful heart



    

                   

In a thankful heart



    

                   

- Okay. Okay.

- Oh. Yes. Yes.



    

                   

Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Yes.



    

                   

Bob Cratchit!



    

                   

- So here you are.

- Uh. M-M-Mr Scrooge. Uh...



    

                   

You. Sir. Were not at work this morning

as we had discussed.



    

                   

Oh. But-but. Mr Scrooge. Sir.

we did discuss it.



    

                   

It's Christmas Day.

You gave me the day off.



    

                   

I? I. Ebenezer Scrooge?



    

                   

- Would I do a thing like that?

- No.



    

                   

I mean yes.

But-But you did.



    

                   

Bob Cratchit.

I've had my fill of this.



    

                   

- And I have had my fill of you.

Mr Scrooge.

- Emily! Emily! Mr Scrooge.



    

                   

- And therefore. Bob Cratchit...

- And therefore. You can leave

this house at once!



    

                   

And therefore. I'm about

to raise your salary.



    

                   

- Oh! And I am about to raise you right

off the pavement and out... Pardon?

- Pardon?



    

                   

Yes. Bob. Raise your salary...



    

                   

and pay your mortgage

on this house.



    

                   

- Please. Sir. Come inside. Uh. Yes.

- Oh. Yes. Yes.



    

                   

Bob Cratchit. Would you

and your family...



    

                   

care to join us for a little turkey dinner

on this fine Christmas Day?



    

                   

Merry Christmas!



    

                   

- Ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

- Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho-ho!



    

                   

- Try a truffle?

- Oh. My goodness.

- I don't know...



    

                   

And Scrooge was

better than his word.



    

                   

He did it all

and infinitely more!



    

                   

And. Uh. Tiny Tim?



    

                   

- And Tiny Tim. Who did not die...

- Aw. Isn't that swell!



    

                   

To Tiny Tim. Scrooge

became a second father.



    

                   

He became as good a friend.

as good a master and as good a man...



    

                   

- As the good old city ever had!

- Hmm.



    

                   

And It was always said of him that he

knew how to keep Christmas well...



    

                   

if any man alive

possessed the knowledge.



    

                   

May that truly be said of us.

and all of us!



    

                   

And so.

as Tiny Tim observed...



    

                   

God bless us.



    

                   

God bless us. Every one!



    

                   

The love we found



    

                   

The love we found



    

                   

We carry with us



    

                   

So we're never

quite alone



    

                   

The love we found



    

                   

The love we found



    

                   

The sweetest dream



    

                   

That we have ever known



    

                   

- Hey! See ya later!

- Goodbye!

- The love we found



    

                   

The love we found



    

                   

- We carry with us

- Bye-bye!

- Goodbye!



    

                   

So we're never

quite alone



    

                   

- Nice story. Mr Dickens.

- Oh. Thanks.



    

                   

- Lf you like this.

- Ho-ho-ho-ho!



    

                   

It's in the singing

of a street corner choir



    

                   

- It's going home and getting warm

by the fire

- Merry Christmas!



    

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



    

                   

- It feels like Christmas

- Yes. It does!



    

                   

The cup of kindness

that we share with another



    

                   

- A sweet reunion with a friend

or a brother

- Hello!



    

                   

In all the places

you find love



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

It is the season of the heart



    

                   

A special time of caring



    

                   

The ways of love made clear



    

                   

And it is

the season of the spirit



    

                   

The message

if we hear it



    

                   

Is make it last all year



    

                   

Ho-ho-ho! Yes!



    

                   

- Make it last all year.

- So we give our gift to another



    

                   

- A pair of mittens that were

made by your mother

- Merry Christmas!



    

                   

- It's all the ways that we show love

- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!



    

                   

- That feel like Christmas

- Yes.



    

                   

A part of childhood

we'll always remember



    

                   

- It is the summer of the soul

in December

- Bye-bye!



    

                   

- Yes, when you do your best for love

- Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!



    

                   

- It feels like Christmas

- And remember...



    

                   

It is the season of the heart



    

                   

A special time of caring



    

                   

The ways of love made clear



    

                   

It is the season of the spirit



    

                   

The message

if we hear it



    

                   

Is make it last all year



    

                   

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!



    

                   

Yes!



    

                   

It's in the singing

of a street corner choir



    

                   

It's going home and getting

warm by the fire



    

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

It's true

wherever you find love



    

                   

It feels like



    

                   

Christmas



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

- It feels like Christmas!

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

- It feels like Christmas



    

                   

It feels like Christmas



    

                   

There comes a moment

in your life



    

                   

Like a window

and you see



    

                   

Your future there before you



    

                   

And how perfect

life can be



    

                   

But adventure calls



    

                   

With unknown voices

calling you away



    

                   

Be careful

or you may regret



    

                   

The choice you make someday



    

                   

When love is gone



    

                   

When love is gone



    

                   

The sweetest dream



    

                   

That we have ever known



    

                   

When love is gone



    

                   

When love is gone



    

                   

I wish you well



    

                   

But I must leave you now alone



    

                   

It was almost love



    

                   

It was almost always



    

                   

It was like a fairy tale



    

                   

We'd live out

you and I



    

                   

And, yes, some dreams

come true



    

                   

Yes, some dreams

fall through



    

                   

And, yes, the time

has come for us



    

                   

To say goodbye



    

                   

Yes, some dreams

come true



    

                   

Yes, some dreams

fall through



    

                   

Yes, the time has come

for us



    

                   

To say goodbye
