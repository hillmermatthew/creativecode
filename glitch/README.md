# Glitch Art 

Various "glitch art" images and videos that I put together using techniques like Databending, Datamoshing, and Pixel Sorting.

I started with a picture of Obama as my main source image to try and glitch, but I ended up playing with a few other images as well.
The only concrete theme here is that I thought these were all cool, they're all things I like the style of.

To view all of the images in an easy "Gallery" style format, check out http://glitch.mattswebsite.net/ 

### Databending
For "Cool" and "Costanza", I got a neat overlay effect by loading the same picture into multiple audio tracks in Audacity and applyiing different effects to each.  For this to work, I had to make sure the beginning of the duplicate track was muted, that way it wouldn't interfere with any of the important code at the start of the first one.
"Selfie" was made in a similar way, but by layering two entirely different images over one another.
"ObamaInvert" and "PinkObama" were just made by toying around with individual effects in Audacity.
"ObamaGlitch" was made by opening it in Notepad++ and typing in random stuff until it looked cool.

### Datamoshing
"obamaDoor" and "The_Glitch" were both made using Avidemux to glitch video files through P and B frame duplication.
With "The_Glitch", though I also did some Databending in Notepad++ on individual frames and re-spliced them back into the video.

### Pixel Sorting
"Boom" was made by pixel-sorting a picture of an explosion, and "ObamaSort" was just pixel-sorting the Obama pic.
"Cyberfall" was actually a picture of Obama at the beginning, but I completely destroyed it by applying a paulstretch to it in audacity, and then I ran the resulting image through the pixel-sorting program twice until it looked like a weird digital waterfall thing.
