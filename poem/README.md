# BeePoem

This project is a poem generator in Python. To see it run, download the [python script](beepoem.py) and run it in a Python notebook.  As long as you're running it in a Python notebook, it should install the necessary stuff on its own. 

You can feed it any text file containing lots of sentences that you'd like, but I was using the Bee Movie Script for my test runs.

Basically I just set up a template poem that gets filled-in with random nouns, verbs, adjectives, and sentences from the text file provided.  It's almost like one of those children's "Mad Libs" games where they fill in the blanks with random words to create an amusing story.  I tried to structure it in a way that will resemble real poetry despite the random elements.  Also, I hardcoded bees into the template, so no matter what text you give it, it's always comparing something to bees.  This was by design.  The bees are important.

I would consider this to be poetry mainly because it's doing something creative and interesting with language in general, but it probably does help that I wrote my template to resemble a conventional poem in some ways.  It doesn't rhyme or anything, but it just has that strong poem energy, ya know?

Here's a few examples of the poetry this bot can create:

-------------------------

### -The stand is a bee-
<br>
The stand is a bee.<br>
The angel is a bee.<br>
The matter is a bee.<br>
All are coming, as is the bee.<br>

<br>
LET with the bee.<br>
BREAK with the bee.<br>
BE with the bee.<br>
And always be lucky with the bee.<br>
<br>
Bee is proud.<br>
Bee is little.<br>
<br>
And when the bee exclaims with all of its lastness: <br>
     "You bee that! "<br>
The bee of the World becomes different.<br>
The bee of the World becomes bee.<br>

### -The face is a bee-
<br>

The joke of the World becomes bee.<br>

-------------------------

### -The bee is a bee-
<br>

And always be one with the bee.<br>
<br>

<br>
And when the bee exclaims with all of its bigness: <br>
     ""They turn the honey, and we turn the money"? "<br>
The lifesaver of the World becomes sweet.<br>
The lifesaver of the World becomes bee.<br>
