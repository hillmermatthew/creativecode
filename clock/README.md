# The Never-Ending Windows Update Clock

This is an abstract clock I made with p5.js, designed to resemble the Windows 10 Update screen. The easiest way to see it in action is to check it out [here](https://editor.p5js.org/hillmermatthew/present/ozX4sc7Lr).  Alternatively, you can copy the contents of [the javascript file](sketch.js), as well as the [Font file](Segoe.ttf) and [circle gif](Win10LoadingDots.gif), into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

To read the clock's time, you look at the current update number for the hour (for example, 2 PM corresponds to Update 14/24), then look at the percentage of that update's completion to see the percentage of the hour that has elapsed (for example, 30 minutes would be 50%).

I like this clock a lot.  Everyone I've shown this to has expressed a deep discomfort with the association to Windows Updates, especially given how accurately I was able to re-create the design aesthetically.  Windows Updates are something that tend to take an uncomfortably long time, leaving people waiting extensively for them to finish so they can get back to using their computer, so the idea of this re-creation never ending and simply displaying the time instead is pretty funny to me.  I guess it's maybe also playing around with how time is represented in general, with the displaying of minutes as a completion percentage instead of actual minutes.  There's probably something more deep and thought-provoking that I could say about representing time that way, but instead I'm just gonna focus on how it's a funny Windows Update meme because it's funnier to me that way.
