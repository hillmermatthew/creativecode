# Bot Project

This bot, [@LigmaBot](https://twitter.com/LigmaBot), is meant to create and share random Ligma Jokes composed of random nouns and verbs placed into one of multiple preset templates.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
