# "Planets" Screensaver

This project is a space-themed "screensaver" consisting of colorful falling 3D "Planet" spheres on a black background.  I created this in the [p5js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org).  

You can view it [here](https://editor.p5js.org/hillmermatthew/present/Yfd0Z1iC2), or you can play around with the code itself by copying the javascript [source code](planets.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).

Shoutouts to [TheCodingTrain's "Starfield" example](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/1wLHIck3T) (as well as the various sample code snippets found in the [p5js "References" page](https://p5js.org/reference/)), they were really helpful for helping me learn the necessary concepts to make this.
